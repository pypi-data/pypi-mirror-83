        ```
        pip install py3js
        ```
        
        ## Supports
        
        - Force-directed graphs
        
        ## Examples
        
        Interactive examples are available in [Jupyter NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aloneguid/py3js/tree/main/examples/).
