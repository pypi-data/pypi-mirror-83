    xgboost_dask:
        name: XGBoost-Dask
        handle: mlflow-xgboost_dask
        version: 1.0.0
        available libraries: XGBoost, Dask
        short description: MLflow and Dask based XGBoost template.
        long description: A MLflow based XGBoost template with CPU, single-GPU, multi-GPU and
                        system-intelligence support. The initialized project contains a Covertype example.
                        Due to Dask's non deterministic shuffling the template may not always be reproducible!
