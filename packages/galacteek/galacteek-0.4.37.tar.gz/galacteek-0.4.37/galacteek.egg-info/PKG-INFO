        **galacteek** is a multi-platform Qt5-based browser/toolbox
        for the IPFS_ peer-to-peer network.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Stable release
        --------------
        
        * **AppImage (Linux)**: `Galacteek-0.4.37-x86_64.AppImage <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/releases/download/v0.4.37/Galacteek-0.4.37-x86_64.AppImage>`_
        * **DMG (MacOS)**: `Galacteek-0.4.37.dmg <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/releases/download/v0.4.37/Galacteek-0.4.37.dmg>`_
        
        Beta
        ----
        
        * Check out the `latest beta images <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/releases/tag/pimp-my-dweb-9/>`_
        
        *On Linux*: Be sure to install all the **gstreamer** packages on your
        system to be able to use the mediaplayer. Problem with the AppImage ?
        `Check the wiki <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/wiki/AppImage#troubleshooting>`_
        or `file an issue <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/issues/new?assignees=&labels=appimage&template=appimage-issue.md&title=Cannot+run+the+AppImage>`_
        
        *On MacOS*: After opening/mounting the DMG image, hold Control and click on the
        **galacteek** icon, and select **Open** and accept. You probably need to
        allow the system to install applications *from anywhere* in the security
        settings. `Create an issue <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/issues/new?assignees=&labels=dmg&template=dmg-issue.md&title=Cannot+run+the+DMG+image>`_ if you
        have problems running the DMG image.
        
        You'll need to have *git* installed to sync hashmarks repositories.
        See the releases_ page for all releases.

        Features
        ========
        
        **galacteek** can either spawn an IPFS daemon and use it as transport, or
        connect to an existing IPFS daemon. By default it will try to run a daemon. You
        can change the IPFS connection settings by clicking on the settings icon in the
        toolbar and restart the application afterwards. If using a custom daemon, you
        should enable pubsub and p2p streams, or some features won't be available
        (`Check this page <https://github.com/pinnaculum/galacteek/wiki/Setup-your-daemon>`_
        for more information).
        
        - Decentralized Identifiers (DID) support with IPID_
        - Browser-to-browser DID authentication over libp2p streams
          (Verifiable Credentials with RSA-PSS)
        - Browsing sessions with automatic pinning (pins every page you browse)
        - Distributed chat with pubsub (chat channels syncronized with CRDT+DAG)
        - File manager with drag-and-drop support and timeframes (per-day view
          of files in the MFS)
        - File sharing
        - Search content with the ipfs-search_ search engine as well as with cyber_
        - Built-in blog with Atom feeds
        - Webcam to IPFS capture (image and videos)
        - Basic built-in media player with IPFS-stored playlists
        - Image viewer and QR codes support
        - Use the IPFS filestore to avoid file duplication
        - ENS_ (Ethereum Name Service) resolving (access to ENS+IPFS websites)
        - Run WASM binaries with wasmer_ (use *Open* on a WASM object from the
          clipboard manager)
        
        Command-line usage
        ==================
        
        Use the *-d* command-line switch to enable debugging output. Using *--profile* gives
        you the ability to have separate application profiles (*main* is the default
        profile). Use *--help* for all options.
        
        You can run the IPFS daemon in *offline* mode, using **--offline**
        
        Enable colorized log output with **--log-color**
        
        *Development*: Use *--monitor* to enable event-loop monitoring with aiomonitor_
        (install aiomonitor_ manually as it's not a dependency).
        Then connect to the aiomonitor_ interface with **nc localhost 50101**
        
        Keyboard shortcuts
        ==================
        
        Please see the shortcuts_ page (or from the application, click on the
        Information icon in the toolbar, which will open the documentation).
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        For instructions on how to build the application, look at the
        BUILDING_ page.
        
        Contributions
        =============
        
        Contributions that can help:
        
        - Write DID services (a chat service using JSON-LD for example)
        - UI translations (French, Spanish)
        - Manual translations (French, Spanish)
        
        Platforms supported
        ===================
        
        - Linux (main target)
        - MacOS
        - FreeBSD (or any BSD OS, with manual build)
        
        Because of the nature of the software's stack (asyncio/Quamash),
        support for any other platform is unlikely.
