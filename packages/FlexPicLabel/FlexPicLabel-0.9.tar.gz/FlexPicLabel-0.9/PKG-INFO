Description: Compound widget to work around some shortcomings in Qt image display.
        
            - Animated GIFs will animate, like in a browser, by transparently switching
              between QImage and QMovie internally depending on the number of frames
              detected by QImageReader.
            - Content will scale up or down to fit the widget while preserving its
              aspect ratio and will do so without imposing a minimum size of 100%.
            - Letterbox/pillarbox borders will default to black.
              (It's a bit of a toss-up whether an application will want this or the
               default window background colour, so this defaults to the choice that
               provides an example of how to accomplish it.)
        
            Note that QImageReader doesn't have an equivalent to GdkPixbufLoader's
            `area-prepared` and `area-updated` signals, so incremental display for
            for high-speed scanning (ie. hitting "next" based on a partially loaded
            images) isn't really possible. The closest one can get is to experiment
            with QImageReader's support for loading just part of a JPEG file to see if
            it can be done without significantly adding to the whole-image load time.
