### AJP Proxy

----

The *ajp* container implements an *Apache2 AJP proxy* that forwards incoming requests to an *ajp* listener
on a different host. *AJP* is the *Apache JServ Protocol* and is used to establish a fast communication
channel between frontend and backend servers.

Then you install a *tomcat* server, the port ``8080`` is usually used for the webinterface. Additionally
the port ``8009`` is also opened by default and provides an *AJP* listener. Whereas the webinterface at ``8080``
supports ordinary *HTTP* requests, the *AJP* listener on ``8009`` expects incoming requests to follow the
*AJP* specification. This is useful, in situations where you do not want *tomcat* as your frontend server.
In this case, you set up an ordinary *Apache2 web server* as the frontend and forward incoming requests to the
*tomcat* by using *AJP* on port ``8009``. Since the *AJP* protocol is a binary protocol, this is more efficient
than just forwarding plain *HTTP* requests.

Summarized: *AJP* is just another way to access the contents of a webserver. Sometimes you find the ordinary
webinterface of an application blocked (e.g. by firewall rules), but the *AJP* port is open. In these cases,
you can still perform some webserver enumeration on the *AJP* port.
That being said, all the ordinary tools usually focus on *HTTP* servers and are not compatible with *AJP*.
In these cases you can use this container. It opens a webserver on your local machine which forwards all
incoming requests to an *AJP* listener of your choice.


### Example

----

The following text describes an example usage. First of all, we start with the output of *nmap* for a *tomcat*
server with *AJP* enabled (notice that the webinterface is filtered and it is not possible to access the
*tomcat* via *HTTP*).

```console
[qtc@kali ~]$ nmap -p8009,8080 172.17.0.1
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-16 05:13 CEST
Nmap scan report for 172.17.0.1
Host is up (0.00011s latency).

PORT     STATE    SERVICE
8009/tcp open     ajp13
8080/tcp filtered http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.31 seconds
```

To access the *tomcat* server via *AJP*, we startup the *ajp* container of *container-arsenal*. However,
just running ``car run ajp`` is not sufficient in this case, as the container needs to know where to
redirect incoming *HTTP* requests. This can be configured either by running ``car mirror ajp`` and adjusting
the environment variable ``HOST`` within the ``docker-compose.yml`` file, or by specifying
the ``car_target_host`` environment variables during the startup:

```console
[qtc@kali ~]$ car_target_host=172.17.0.1 car run ajp
[+] Environment Variables:
[+]	car_local_uid                 1000
[+]	car_ajp_folder                /home/qtc/arsenal/ajp
[+]	car_log_folder                /home/qtc/arsenal/ajp
[+]	car_target_port               8009
[+]	car_target_host               172.17.0.1
[+]	car_http_port                 8001
[+] 
[+] Running: sudo -E docker-compose up
Starting car.ajp ... done

```

Now we can access the *tomcat* server by using the webserver exposed by the container. Notice that the container runs in *host networking mode*. Therefore,
it does not have its own IP address but uses the *network namespace* of your local machine instead. You can access the webserver via *localhost*.

```html
[qtc@kali ~]$ ss -tlnp
State                    Recv-Q                   Send-Q                                     Local Address:Port                                       Peer Address:Port
LISTEN                   0                        4096                                       127.0.0.1:8001                                           0.0.0.0:*

[qtc@kali ~]$ curl 127.0.0.1:8001
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>HTTP Status 404 – Not Found</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>HTTP Status 404 – Not Found</h1>
        <hr class="line" />
        <p><b>Type</b> Status Report</p>
        <p><b>Message</b> Not found</p>
        <p><b>Description</b> The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.</p>
        <hr class="line" />
        <h3>Apache Tomcat/9.0.30</h3>
    </body>
</html>
```

From the server banner at the end of the response you can see, that we are indeed talking to the *tomcat* server.


### Networking Mode

----

As network performance is relevant for the *ajp* container, the container runs with *host networking mode*. This means that the *network isolation* that *docker*
usually provides doesn't apply for this container. However, isolation for other resources like file system or process namespace is still in place.


### Configuration Options

----

The following configuration options can be adjusted within your ``car.toml`` configuration file:

* ``http_port``: *HTTP* proxy port on your local machine.
* ``target_host``: Targeted server that exposes the *AJP* listener.
* ``target_port``: *AJP* port of the targeted server. Most of the times ``8009`` (the default) is what you want.
* ``ajp_folder``: Top level ressource folder of the *AJP* container.
* ``log_folder``: Folder where *mod_jk* logs are stored (volume).

You can also specify these options by using environment variables. The command ``car env ajp`` explains their corresponding usage:

```console
[qtc@kali ~]$ car env ajp
[+] Available environment variables are:
[+] Name                Current Value                   Description
[+] car_http_port       8001                            HTTP proxy port on your local machine.
[+] car_log_folder      /home/qtc/arsenal/ajp           Folder where mod_jk logs are stored (volume).
[+] car_target_host     172.17.0.1                      Targeted server that exposes the AJP listener.
[+] car_target_port     8009                            AJP port of the targeted server. Most of the times 8009 (the default) is what you want.
[+] car_local_uid       1000                            UID of the Apache user.
```
