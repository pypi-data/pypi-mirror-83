# Simple File Format Converter

## Converting Images to Fits

This option is currently unavailable due to invalid information transfer. 
Currently converting to fits files does not properly retain metadata and is leading to a corrupted fits file. Although running the convert-img command with fits will result in a fits file being produced, it does not currently produce a valid fits file.

## Converting Images

Simply run 'letsformat convert-img' and the CLI will guide you through each step to convert the image file into your desired format.

## Issues
