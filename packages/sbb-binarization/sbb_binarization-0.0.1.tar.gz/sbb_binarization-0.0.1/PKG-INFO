        ## Introduction
        
        This tool performs document image binarization (i.e. transform colour/grayscale
        to black-and-white pixels) for OCR using multiple trained models.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Clone the repository, enter it and run  
        
        `pip install .`
        
        ### Models
        
        Pre-trained models can be downloaded from here:

        ## Usage 
        
        ```sh
        sbb_binarize \
          -m <directory with models> \
          -i <image file> \
          -p <set to true to let the model see the image divided into patches> \
          -s <directory where the results will be saved>`
        ```
