        ## Introduction
        
        This tool performs document image binarization (i.e. transform colour/grayscale
        to black-and-white pixels) for OCR using multiple trained models.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Clone the repository, enter it and run
        
        `pip install .`
        
        ### Models
        
        Pre-trained models can be downloaded from here:   
        
        https://qurator-data.de/sbb_binarization/
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```sh
        sbb_binarize \
          --patches \
          -m <directory with models> \
          <input image> \
          <output image>
        ```
        
        **Note** In virtually all cases, the `--patches` flag will improve results.
