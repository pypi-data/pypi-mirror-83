class context(contextlib.ContextDecorator):
    """
    A context manager that groups changes under the same context and
    adds additional metadata about the event.

    Context is added as variables at the beginning of every SQL statement.
    By default, all variables are localized to the transaction (i.e
    SET LOCAL), meaning they will only persist for the statement/transaction
    and not across the session.

    Once any code has entered ``pghistory.context``, all subsequent
    entrances of ``pghistory.context`` will be grouped under the same
    context until the top-most parent exits.

    To add context only if a parent has already entered ``pghistory.context``,
    one can call ``pghistory.context`` as a function without entering it.
    The metadata set in the function call will be part of the context if
    ``pghistory.context`` has previously been entered. Otherwise it will
    be ignored.

    Usage:

        with pghistory.context(key='value'):
            # Do things..
            # All tracked events will have the same ``pgh_context``
            # foreign key, and the context object will include
            # {'key': 'value'} in its metadata.
            # Nesting the tracker adds additional metadata to the current
            # context

        # Add metadata if a parent piece of code has already entered
        # pghistory.context
        pghistory.context(key='value')

    Args:
        metadata (dict): Metadata that should be attached to the tracking
            context

    Notes:
        Context tracking is compatible for most scenarios, but it currently
        does not work for named cursors. Django uses named cursors for
        the .iterator() operator, which has no effect on history tracking.
        However, there may be other usages of named cursors in Django where
        history context is ignored.
