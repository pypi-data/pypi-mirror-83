### Statement of Purpose

> The intent of the Little Python programming language is to implement a simple language that is easy for people with little to no coding experience to create a program. The need for such a language arose when creating a framework for competitions  where individuals of all skill levels can create a rudimentary AI to compete against various challenges. We wanted to “level” the playing field by having a language that is limited in functionality and is unfamiliar to anyone. Please keep this in mind when suggesting and/or commenting on the design features.

### Install
Run this following command to install from PyPI.

```pip install littlepython```

### Setup for development
Run ```pip install -e .``` to install the package locally using sym links so changes to the code in the repo will be reflected globally.
To run all the tests run ```python setup.py test```.
