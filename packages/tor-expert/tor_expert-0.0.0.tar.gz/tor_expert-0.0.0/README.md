# About
The main objective of this project is to create an instance of tor expert that can<br>
be used in the same way as the tor browser.

# Installation
Most important thing is that you have python 3 installed on your machine. 

**Deploy virtual environment for your project**<br>
Install virtualenv library if you didn't already.```pip3.7 install virtualenv```
For this project, I'm using Python 3.7 if you have any other python 3 versions <br>
be sure to change the version number on pip. 
Then create virtual environment ```py -3.7 -m virtualenv Envs/myproject``` <br>
In most cases on WinOS it will be created on path ```C:\Users\YourUsername\Envs```<br>

**Activate virtual environment for your project**<br>
Activate by simply calling this command ```C:\Users\YourUsername\Envs\myproject\Scripts\activate.bat``` from command prompt.
