Description: # OpenPlantbook
        Open Plantbook is a free service to access plant data. Anyone can use information from the database for any purpose without limitations.
        
        
        
        ## Requrements
        In order to use this API you need to login to Open Plantbook web UI at https://open.plantbook.io and generate API credentials. The credentials are client_id and client_secret. API authentication implements OAuth2 standard Client Credentials Grant flow.
        
        ## Usage
        
        The library is written with async functions.
        
        
        ```
        import asyncio
        
        from pyopenplantbook import OpenPlantBookApi
        
        client_id = "xxxx"
        secret = "yyyy"
        
        api = OpenPlantBookApi(client_id=client_id, secret=secret)
        
        async def get_plant(species):
            plant = await api.get_plantbook_data(species=species)
            return plant
        
        def main():
            loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
            asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
            result = loop.run_until_complete(get_plant("coleus 'marble'"))
            print(result)
        
        main()
        ```
