Description: ExaVault Python API SDK - v2.0
        ============
        
        Welcome to ExaVault's PHP code library for our v2 API. Use our API to interact with all aspects of the service the same way our web portal would. The library is generated from our API's [public swagger YAML file](https://www.exavault.com/api/docs/evapi_2.0_public.yaml)
        
        ## Requirements 
        
        The SDK supports the following versions of Python:
        
        -  Python 2 versions 2.7.9 and later
        -  Python 3 versions 3.4 and later
        
        You must also have an ExaVault API key and access token. For more information, please refer to our [API Documentation](https://www.exavault.com/developer/api-docs/#section/Obtaining-Your-API-Key-and-Access-Token) or contact support@exavault.com for details.
        
        ## Installation
        
        1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/ExaVault/evapi-python.git evapi-python` or manually download the library.
        2. Run setup script `python setup.py install` Depending on your python setup, you may need to run the script as root; e.g. `sudo python setup.py install`
        
        ## Getting started
        Install the latest SDK using pip:
        
        ```sh
        pip install exavault
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can download or clone the sdk from [Python SDK] and then install the SDK by running Setuptools in the SDK installation directory:
        
        ```sh
        python setup.py install 
        ```
        
        ## Sample Code
        
        For a gentle introduction to using Python code with ExaVault's API, check out [our code samples](https://github.com/ExaVault/evapi-python-samples). Follow the instructions in that repository's README to run the sample scripts, which will demonstrate how to use several of the APIs to interact with your ExaVault account.
        
        ## Writing Your Own Code
        
        When you're ready to write your own code using this library, you'll need to:
        
        1. Install our code library in your project, either with `pip install exavault` or by downloading this repository and importing the package directly
        1. Provide your API key and access token with every function method on the Api classes
        1. Whenever you instantiate an Api object (ResourcesApi, UsersApi, etc.), override the configuration to point the code at the correct API URL:
        ```python
        from exavault import AccountApi
        ACCOUNT_URL = "https://YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE.exavault.com/api/v2/";
        account_api = AccountApi()
        account_api.api_client.configuration.host = ACCOUNT_URL
        ```
        ```python
        from exavault import ResourcesApi
        ACCOUNT_URL = "https://YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE.exavault.com/api/v2/";
        resources_api = ResourcesApi()
        resources_api.api_client.configuration.host = ACCOUNT_URL
        ```
        ```python
        from exavault import NotificationsApi
        ACCOUNT_URL = "https://YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE.exavault.com/api/v2/";
        notifications_api = NotificationsApi()
        notifications_api.api_client.configuration.host = ACCOUNT_URL
        ```
