        A SMS/MMS encoder/decoder written 100% in Python.
        
        History
        =======
        
        Originally written by Paul Hardwick with some bits from Dave Berkeley's
        pysms. It was imported in the Wader and MobileManager projects and
        quickly became clear that a joint effort would be more beneficial for
        everyone.
        
        In 2010, the superb python-mms package by Francois Aucamp was merged
        into python-messaging to provide a complete SMS/MMS encoder/decoder.
        
        In 2011, as part of a license clarification, Francis Aucamp was
        contacted and asked if it were possible to relicence his MMS portions as
        GPLv2, he responded: "feel free to re-license the parts of the
        python-mms code you are using in your python-messaging project to GPL
        v2; you have my full consent."
