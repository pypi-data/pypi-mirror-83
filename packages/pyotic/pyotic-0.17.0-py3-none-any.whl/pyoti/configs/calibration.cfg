#
#Parameters
#----------
#beta : tuple or array (n)
#    The displacement sensitivity at the position, where the center of
#    the bead would be on the surface (m/V).
#kappa : tuple or array (n)
#    The stiffness at the position, where the center of the bead would
#    be on the surface (N/m).
#radiusspec : float
#    The radius, as it was specified by the manufacturer (m).
#focalshift : float
#    The focalshift of the Setup.
#mbeta : tuple or array (n), optional
#    The slope of the displacement sensitivity in units of beadcenter-surface
#    distance (i.e. focalshift corrected units of positionZ, m/V/m),
#    (numpy.zeros(n), default).
#mkappa : tuple or array (n), optional
#    The slope of the stiffness in units of beadcenter-surface distance
#    (i.e. focalshift corrected units of positionZ, N/m/m),
#    (numpy.zeros(n), default).
#corrfactor : float, optional
#    The correction factor of the size of the bead (i.e. the relative
#    stokes drag coefficient far in the solution), (1.0, default).
#dsurf : float, optional
#    The value of positionZ, where the center of the bead would be on the
#    surface (0.0, default).
