Python package for manipulating LiveMaker 3 game resources.
Specifically intended to work with LiveNovel VN's, but extraction
should also work for other LiveMaker games.

Based on tinfoil's irl_.

Requires Python 3 (3.6 and later).


* Free software: GNU General Public License v3
* Documentation: https://pylivemaker.readthedocs.io.

.. _irl: https://bitbucket.org/tinfoil/irl


Features
--------

* Extract files from a LiveMaker .exe or .dat file.
* Dump LSB files to human-readable text or XML (similar to LiveMaker's XML .lsc format).
* Extract LiveNovel LNS scripts from LSB files.
* Compile (modified) LNS scripts and insert them into LSB files.
* Patch (modified) LSB files into an existing .exe or .dat file.

=======
History
=======

1.0.1 (2020-10-25)
------------------

* Fix menu support for certain LM engine versions
* Add experimental ruby/furigana support (supported in LNS scripts only)

1.0.0 (2020-07-01)
------------------

* Added ``lmlpb`` tool for editing LPB project parameters
* Added ``livemaker.lsb.translate`` API
* Added menu translation API, text and LPM (image) menus are now supported
* Standardized CSV format for translatable text
* All CSV commands now support the ``--encoding`` parameter
* Fixed old logging bugs
* Added experimental ``lmgraph lsb`` command for generating LSB file execution graphs
* Added ``lmbmp`` helper utility for generating ``BmpToGale`` compatible image + mask pairs

Known issues:

* CSV scenario script translation does not currently support formatting tags.
  If you need advanced tag support, you will need to use the LNS script
  translation method.

Deprecated:

* ``--mode=lines`` for scenario text CSV commands
* Old CSV format (CSV files generated in 0.3.x are not compatible with 1.0)

0.3.2 (2020-05-04)
------------------

This will be the final release before v1.0.0 (which will break backwards compatibility with this release).

* Added ``extractcsv`` command for extracting scenario text to a CSV file
* Added ``insertcsv`` command for replacing scenario text from a CSV file
* Added ``lmlpb`` CLI tool for manipulating LPB project settings files.

Known issues:

* `extractmenu` and `insertmenu` commands only support using system locale/encoding when reading and writing CSV files.

Deprecated:

* Python 3.5 support.
  Future releases of pylivemaker will require Python 3.6 and later.
* Existing CSV CLI tool is deprecated.
  Future releases of pylivemaker will use a different CSV format which will not be compatible with CSV files generated in this release.

0.3.0 (2020-04-30)
------------------

* Added `extractmenu` command for extracting in-game menus to a CSV file
* Added `insertmenu` command for replacing in-game menus from a CSV file
* `lmpatch` now supports batch/recursive patching

0.2.1 (2020-03-13)
------------------

* Added `lmgraph` command for generating LSB script call graphs
* Refactored CLI tools (each tool moved to its own source file)

0.2.0 (2020-02-16)
------------------

* Added support for reading LM Pro scrambled (encrypted) archives
* ``HAlignEnum`` and ``VAlignEnum`` in ``livemaker/lsb/novel.py`` have been removed and replaced with ``AlignEnum``

0.1.2 (2020-02-05)
------------------

* Added support for split VFF archives
* Added ``lmlsb edit`` command
* Added ``lmlsb batchinsert`` command
