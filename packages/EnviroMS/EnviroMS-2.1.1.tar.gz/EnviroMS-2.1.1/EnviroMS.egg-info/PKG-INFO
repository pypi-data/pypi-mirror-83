Description: # EnviroMS
        
        **EnviroMS** is a workflow for natural organic matter data processing and annotation
        
        ## Current Version
        
        ### `2.1.1`
        
        ### Data input formats
        
        - Generic mass list in profile and centroid mode (include all delimiters types and Excel formats)
        
        ### Data output formats
        
        - Pandas data frame (can be saved using pickle, h5, etc)
        - Text Files (.csv, tab separated .txt, etc)
        - Microsoft Excel (xlsx)
        - Automatic JSON for workflow metadata
        - Self-containing Hierarchical Data Format (.hdf5) including raw data and ime-series data-point for processed data-sets with all associated workflow metadata (JSON)
        
        ### Data structure types
        
        - FT-ICR MS
        - LC-FT-ICR MS
        
        ### Molecular formulae search and assignment
        
        - Automatic local (SQLite) or external (PostgreSQL) database check, generation, and search
        - Automatic molecular formulae assignments algorithm for ESI(-) MS for natural organic matter analysis
        - Automatic fine isotopic structure calculation and search for all isotopes
        - Flexible Kendrick normalization base
        - Kendrick filter using density-based clustering
        - Kendrick classification
        - Hetero atoms classification and visualization
        
        
        ## EnviroMS Installation
        
        - PyPi:     
        ```bash
        pip3 install enviroms
        ```
        
        - From source:
         ```bash
        pip3 install --editable .
        ```
        
        To be able to open thermo raw files a installation of pythonnet is needed:
        - Windows: 
            ```bash
            pip3 install pythonnet
            ```
        
        - Mac and Linux:
            ```bash
            brew install mono
            pip3 install pythonnet   
            ```
        
        ## Running the workflow
        
        
        ```bash
        enviroMS dump-corems-enviroms-template EnviromsFile.json
        ```
        ```bash
        enviroMS dump-corems-template CoremsFile.json
        ```
        
         Modify the EnviromsFile.json and CoremsFile.json accordingly to your dataset and workflow parameters
        make sure to include CoremsFile.json path inside the EnviromsFile.json: "corems_json_path": "path_to_CoremsFile.json" 
        
        ```bash
        enviroMS run-di path_to_MetamsFile.json
        ```
        
        ## EnviroMS Docker 
        
        A docker image containing the EnviroMS command line as code entry-point
        
        If you don't have docker installed, the easiest way is to [install docker for desktop](https://hub.docker.com/?overlay=onboarding)
        
        - Pull from Docker Registry:
        
            ```bash
            docker pull corilo/enviroms:latest
            
            ```
        
        - Or to build the image from source:
        
            ```bash
            docker build -t enviroms:latest .
            ```
        - Run Workflow from Container:
        
            $(data_dir) = dir_containing the FT-ICR MS data, EnviromsFile.json and CoremsFile.json
            
            ```bash
            docker run -v $(data_dir):/enviroms/data corilo/enviroms:latest enviroMS run-di /enviroms/data/EnviromsFile.json    
            ```
        
        - Save a new parameters file template:
            
            ```bash
            docker run -v $(data_dir):/enviroms/data corilo/enviroms:latest enviroMS dump_json_template /enviroms/data/EnviromsFile.json    
            ```
            
            ```bash
            docker run -v $(data_dir):/metaB/data corilo/enviroms:latest enviroMS dump_corems_json_template /metaB/data/CoremsFile.json
            ```
