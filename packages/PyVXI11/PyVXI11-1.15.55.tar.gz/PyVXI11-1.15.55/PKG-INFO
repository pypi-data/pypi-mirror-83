        This is a software to control devices using VXI11 protocol form Python.
        This software based on Cython. There seems exsists softwares with same
        name in the net. If you are looking for the pure-python implementation,
        please visit python-vxi11 page in PyPI.

        How to build
        ------------
        
        > You must have rpcgen command, Cython, and python running on your
        > system.
        
        (If you also wants to build old VXI11.py and related library, you need
        swig).
        
        Python 2.7.17/Python 3.8.0/Cython version 0.29.14 were used to
        test/develop this version on MacOSX 10.15.
        
        The following sequence of commands will build and install VXI11 module
        in your python interpreter.
        
        ``` {.shell}
        %python setup.py build
        %python setup.py install 
        ```
        
        or
        
        ``` {.shell}
        %sudo python setup.py install 
        ```
        
        Before start building, pleas make sure thata there is none of VXI11.py,
        VXI11\_wrap.c, cVXI11.cpp, cVXI11.h, VXI11.h,VXI11\_clnt.c,VXI11\_svc.c
        and VXI11\_xdr.c. These files should be generated using the tools
        mentioned above, ie rpcgen, cython ,swig and are platform dependent. In
        other words, these files created on other platforms may not work on your
        platform.
        
        On MacOSX, you need to setup CC and CXX environments variables. So use:
        
        ``` {.shell}
        %env CC=/usr/bin/clang CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ python setup.py build install
        ```
        
        for building and istalling the software.
        
        binary tools
        ------------
        
        run \"make all\" to create vxi11scan and vxi11\_device\_clear.
        vxi11scan.py nor pyvxi11scan.pyx are not support on this version.
        
        note
        ----
        
        2014.4.1 : SRQ support still is not complete. Sometime it crashes.
        Please use it at your own risk.
        
        2014.4.2 : SQR handler on MacOSX respond to SRQ. However, on Linux, it
        does not get event.
        
        2014.4.4 : Ubuntu installation may not incude /usr/sbin/rpcinfo command.
        You need to install it from the package manager.
        
        2014.4.6 : compilation error. You may have warnings during compilation.
        It does not affects the operation of the software.
        
        2019.4.17 : Support for Python 3. VXI11.rpcl was adjusted for 64bit mode
        compilation.
        
        2020.2.7 : pmap\_getport/pmap\_getmaps are introduced. pmap\_getport ask
        port number for requested program to a portmapper on the host. THe
        function pmap\_getmaps() returns list of services from the portmapper.
        It remvoes dependency on the rpcinfo shell program.
        
        2020.10.22: On MacOS, getifaddrs() is supported.
