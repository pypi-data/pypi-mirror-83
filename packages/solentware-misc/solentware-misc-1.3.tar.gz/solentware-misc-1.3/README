Installation Instructions
=========================

Install the package by typing

   python setup.py install

at the command prompt with setup.py in the current directory.

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> setup.py install

   For example

      C:\\Python33\\python setup.py install

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.3 setup.py install

         on Unix-like systems.

Use `Python`_ 3.3 or later.


Notes
=====

The frame, panel, logpanel,and threadqueue, modules are obsolete given the addition of ttk:notebook to tk after Tk8.4 and access via tkinter.
