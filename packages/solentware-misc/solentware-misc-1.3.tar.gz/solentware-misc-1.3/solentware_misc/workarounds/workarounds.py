"""Workarounds for problems encountered with Tkinter functions at Tcl/Tk 8.5
at Python2.6 or Python2.7.

It is assumed the genuine functions work at Python 2.5 with Tcl/Tk 8.4, if
the feature is supported, and changes in Tcl/Tk 8.5 raise the problem.

    widget.grid_rowconfigure(1, 'pad') and similar do not work at Python 2.6
    because the self.tk.call(...) for the query, in _grid_configure, returns
    an int (maybe a double for width?) rather than a str; at least when
    Tk/Tcl 8.5 is used.

    This function can handle 'weight', 'pad', 'minsize', 'uniform', and
    'all', option queries for columnconfigure and rowconfigure commands.

    Queries on 'uniform' work in the genuine function.
