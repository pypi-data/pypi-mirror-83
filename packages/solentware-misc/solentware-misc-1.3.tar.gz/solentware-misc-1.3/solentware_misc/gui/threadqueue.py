    Provide a background thread and associated queue for submitting tasks using

    Requests to run a background task when one is already running are rejected.

    Use a queue to pass user interface update requests to the main thread for
    execution.  (The background task can report progress to the task log.)
    
    This means all user interface update calls have to be done as:

    Just do <method>(*tuple, **dictionary) if the main thread does the call.

    # Methods __call__, get_reportqueue, __run_ui_task_from_queue, and
    # get_thread_queue, introduced to allow this module to work if tkinter is
    # compiled without --enable-threads as in OpenBSD 5.7 i386 packages.  The
    # standard build from FreeBSD ports until early 2015 at least, when this
    # change was introduced, is compiled with --enable-threads so the unchanged
    # code worked.  Not sure if the change in compiler on FreeBSD from gcc to
    # clang made a difference.  The Microsoft Windows' Pythons seem to be
    # compiled with --enable-threads because the unchanged code works in that
    # environment.  The situation on OS X, and any GNU-Linux distribution, is
    # not known.

    # Code in the solentware_misc.gui.tasklog module already dealt with this
    # problem, so the minimum necessary was copied to here.  The classes in
    # tasklog are modified versions of code present in this module before this
    # change.
