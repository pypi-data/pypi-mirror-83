# MacOS and Linux Prerequisites

1. git ([Installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
2. Download Python version 3.5 or above from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Support for Python 2.7.13 or above is also maintained, but with [its End of Life](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-March/152348.html) soon approaching, it is recommended you start with Python 3.
