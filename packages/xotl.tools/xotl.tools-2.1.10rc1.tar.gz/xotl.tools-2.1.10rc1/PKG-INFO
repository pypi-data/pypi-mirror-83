Description: `xoutil` is a collection of disparate utilities that does not conform a
        framework for anything.  `xoutil` is essentially -but not exclusively- an
        extension to the Python's standard library.
        
        In `xoutil` you will probably find:
        
        - Tools that must be implemented in the Python Standard Library, but there are
          things that escape from the Guido's scope. ;)
        
        - Components that belong naturally to the "Common Systems Layer" \
          [#continuum]_.
        
        - Compatibility solvers for major versions issues\ [#another-six]_.  See
          `xoutil.eight`.
        
          .. note:: Starting with xoutil 2.0, support for Python 2 is no longer
             supported.  Use a version of xoutil 1.9.x to have the latest developments
             with Python 2 support.
        
        
        .. [#another-six] Yes!, yet another solution for this. ;)
