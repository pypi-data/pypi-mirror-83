As expected, LinchPin can also perform :term:`teardown` of :term:`resources`.  A teardown action generally expects that resources have been :term:`provisioned <provision>`. However, because Ansible is idempotent, ``linchpin destroy`` will only check to make sure the resources are up.  Only if the resources are already up will the teardown happen.

The command ``linchpin destroy`` will look up the :term:`resources` and/or :term:`topology` files (depending on the provider) to determine the proper :term:`teardown` procedure. The `dummy` Ansible role does not use the resources, only the topology during teardown.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ linchpin destroy
    target: dummy_cluster, action: destroy
    Action 'destroy' on Target 'dummy_cluster' is complete

    Target              Run ID  uHash       Exit Code
    -------------------------------------------------
    dummy_cluster       71      0446                0


Verify the `/tmp/dummy.hosts` file to ensure the records have been removed.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat /tmp/dummy.hosts
    -- EMPTY FILE --

.. note:: The teardown functionality is slightly more limited around ephemeral
    resources, like networking, storage, etc. It is possible that a network
    resource could be used with multiple cloud instances. In this way,
    performing a ``linchpin destroy`` does not teardown certain resources. This
    is dependent on each providers implementation.
