        ASHLAR: Alignment by Simultaneous Harmonization of Layer/Adjacency Registration
        
        Ashlar implements efficient combined stitching and registration of multi-channel
        image mosaics collected using the Tissue-CycIF microscopy protocol [1]_. Although
        originally developed for CycIF, it may also be applicable to other tiled and/or
        cyclic imaging approaches. The package offers both a command line script for the
        most common use cases as well as an API for building more specialized tools.
        
        .. [1] Tissue-CycIF is multi-round immunofluorescence microscopy on large fixed
           tissue samples. See https://doi.org/10.1101/151738 for details.
