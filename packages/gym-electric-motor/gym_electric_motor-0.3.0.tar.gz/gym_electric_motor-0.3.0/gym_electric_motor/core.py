"""
On the core level the electric motor environment and the interface to its submodules are defined. By using these
interfaces further reference generators, reward functions, visualizations or physical models can be implemented.

Each ElectricMotorEnvironment contains the four following modules:

* PhysicalSystem
    - Specification and simulation of the physical model. Furthermore, specifies limits and nominal values\
    for all of its ``state_variables``.
* ReferenceGenerator
    - Calculation of reference trajectories for one or more states of the physical systems ``state_variables``.
* RewardFunction
    - Calculation of the reward based on the physical systems state and the reference.\
     Furthermore, observation of the physical systems limits.
* ElectricMotorVisualization
    - Visualization of the PhysicalSystems state, reference and reward for the user.

class ElectricMotorEnvironment(gym.core.Env):
    """
    Description:
        The main class connecting all modules of the gym-electric-motor environments.

    Modules:

        Physical System:
            Containing the physical structure and simulation of the drive system as well as information about the
            technical limits and nominal values. Needs to be a subclass of *PhysicalSystem*

        Reference Generator:
            Generation of the reference for the motor to follow. Needs to be a subclass of *ReferenceGenerator*

        Reward Function:
            Calculation of the reward based on the state of the physical system and the generated reference
            and observation if the motor state is within the limits. Needs to be a subclass of *RewardFunction*.

        Visualization:
            Visualization of the motors states. Needs to be a subclass of *ElectricMotorVisualization*

        Limits:
            Returns a list of limits of all states in the observation (called in state_filter) in the same order.

    State Variables:
        Each environment has got a list of state variables that are defined by the physical system.
        These define the names and order for all further state arrays in the modules. These states are announced to the
        other modules by announcing the physical system to them, which contains the property ``state_names``.

        Example:
            ``['omega', 'torque','i', 'u', 'u_sup']``

    Observation:
        Type: Tuple(State_Space, Reference_Space)
            The observation is always a tuple of the State Space of the Physical System and the Reference Space of the
            Reference Generator. In all current Physical Systems and Reference Generators these Spaces are normalized,
            continuous, multidimensional boxes in [-1, 1] or [0, 1].

    Actions:
        Type: Discrete() / Box()
            The action space of the environments are the action spaces of the physical systems. In all current physical
            systems the action spaces are specified by its PowerElectronicConverter and either a continuous,
            multidimensional box or discrete.

    Reward:
        The reward and the reward range are specified by the RewardFunction. In general the reward is higher the closer
        the motor state follows the reference trajectories.

    Starting State:
        The physical system and the reference generator define the starting state.

    Episode Termination:
        Episode terminations can be initiated by the reference generator, or the reward function.
        A reference generator might terminate an episode, if the reference has ended.
        The reward function can terminate an episode, if a physical limit of the motor has been violated.

        values for currently referenced state variables and a default value (e.g zero) for non-referenced variables.
        This reference array is used to calculate rewards.

        Example:

            ``state_variables=['omega', 'torque', 'i', 'u', 'u_sup']`` \n

    Call of get_reference_observation():
        Returns the reference observation, which is shown to the agent.
        Any shape and content is generally valid, however, values must be within the declared reference space.        
        For example, the reference observation may contain future reference values of the next ``n`` steps.

        Example:
            ``reference_observation = np.array([0.8, 0.6, 0.4])`` \n
