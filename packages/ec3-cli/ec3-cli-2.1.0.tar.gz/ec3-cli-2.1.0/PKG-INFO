Description: Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) is a tool to create elastic virtual clusters on topof Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers, either public (such as Amazon Web Services,Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure)or on-premises (such as OpenNebula and OpenStack). We offer recipes to deploy TORQUE(optionally with MAUI), SLURM, SGE, HTCondor, Mesos, Nomad and Kubernetes clusters that can be self-managed with CLUES:it starts with a single-node cluster and working nodes will be dynamically deployed and provisionedto fit increasing load (number of jobs at the LRMS). Working nodes will be undeployed when they are idle.This introduces a cost-efficient approach for Cluster-based computing.
