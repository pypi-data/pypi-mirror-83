# npy2bdv
 A minimalistic library for writing image stacks (numpy arrays) into HDF5 files of 
 Fiji BigDataViewer/BigStitcher format. The library also supports reading from HDF5 into numpy.

 ## Installation
 Run `pip install` from Anaconda prompt, and use `import npy2bdv` in your code.
 
 ## Workflow
 The library accepts any 2d or 3d numpy arrays: (z,y,x) axis order as `stack`, (y,x) as `plane`. 
 The input is converted to `uint16` automatically.
 
 1. a writer object is created: it opens a new h5 file and requires info about setups and saving options: 
 number of setup attributes (e.g. channels, angles), compression, subsampling. 
 2. stacks (3d arrays) can be appended to the h5 file 
 as views by `BdvWriter.append_view(stack, ...)`. 
 Stacks can be normal (whole stack appended at once), or virtual, appended plane by plane.
 The time point `time` and attributes such as `channel`, `angle` etc must be specified 
 for each view.
 
 3. an XML file with all meta information is created in the end by `BdvWriter.write_xml_file(ntimes, ...)`.
 The total number of time points `ntimes` must be specified at this step 
 (it may be unknown in the beginning of acquisition).
  
 4. Writing is finalized by calling `BdvWriter.close()`.

 ## Supported writing options
 * compression methods `None`, `gzip`, `lzf` (`None` by default).
 * downsampling options: 
    - any number of mipmap levels
    - computed via averaging, compatible with BigDataViewer/BigStitcher convention.
 * user-defined block sizes for H5 storage (default `4,256,256`)
 * any number of time points, illuminations, channels, tiles, angles.
 * arbitrary affine transformation for each individual view (e.g. translation, rotation, shear).
 * arbitrary voxel calibration for each view, to account for spatial anisotropy.
 * individual views can differ in dimensions, voxel size, voxel units, exposure time, and exposure units.
 * missing views are labeled automatically.
 * support of additiona meta-information:
    - camera properties: `name`, `exposureTime`, `exposureUnits`
    - `microscope` (name and version), `user`
 * writing virtual stacks of arbitrary size plane-by-plane. Handy when your stack is larger than your RAM.
    - virtual stacks can be written with multiple subsampling levels and compression.

 
 ## Writing speed
Writing speeds up to 2300 MB/s can be achieved on a PC with SSD drive. 
The amount of available RAM does not seem to play role: 
writing on laptop with 16 GB RAM can be faster than on 64 GB RAM mainframe machine, if laptop SSD is faster.

The speed of writing for long time series (>100 stacks) is typically about 700-900 MB/s. 
This is in the range of full-speed camera acquisition 
of Hamamatsu Orca Flash4, 840 MB/s (2048x2048 px at 100 Hz).
