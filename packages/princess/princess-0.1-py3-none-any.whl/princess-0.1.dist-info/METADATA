Princess is a small module to run a Jupyter notebook containing Python code,
with two specific conditions:

- The notebook runs in the current Python environment (the one used to load
  Princess), regardless of the kernel name in its metadata.
- Text output from the notebook is displayed directly in your terminal - or
  wherever you redirect it - so you can follow the progress of the notebook.

Usage::

    python -m princess Notebook.ipynb

Options:

- ``--save`` and ``--save-as Result.ipynb`` to save the notebook after running.
- ``--on-error-resume-next`` ignores errors from running notebook code and
  continues with the next cell. This is usually not a good idea.
