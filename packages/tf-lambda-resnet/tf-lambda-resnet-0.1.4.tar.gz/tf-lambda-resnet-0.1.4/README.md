## LambdaResNet - TensorFlow

> All credit goes to [lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains/) for sharing the initial pytorch implementation. This repo takes majority of contents from his original repo [here](https://github.com/lucidrains/lambda-networks).

Implementation of Î»-ResNet.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install tf-lambda-resnet
```

## Usage

LambdaResNet uses localized context as explained in the video.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tf_lambda_resnet import LambdaResnet18

model = LambdaResnet18()
out = model(tf.ones([10, 224, 224, 3]))
print(out)
```

## Credits

All the code is taken from the below resources. I have assembled them in a proper manner to make it work for TF2.2
