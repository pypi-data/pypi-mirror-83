Instructions for making a new release:

 1) git checkout master
 2) git clean -d -x -f         # I hope you've committed or stashed everything
                               # you are working on
 3) git fetch
 4) git rebase origin
 5) make bumpver
 6) git commit -a -m "New version."
 7) git clean -d -x -f
 8) make release
 9) gpg --detach-sign -a dist/$(make verrel).tar.gz
10) make pypi

The tar.gz and tar.gz.asc files should be uploaded as release artifacts to
github as a new release.

If packaging in RPM format, you might find the 'make rpmlog' target useful.
It gives you an RPM spec file formatted changelog block that contains the
git shortlog entries of all changes since the last tag.

8) git push
9) git push --tags
