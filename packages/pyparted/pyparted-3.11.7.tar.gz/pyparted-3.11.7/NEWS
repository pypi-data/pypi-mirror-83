pyparted-2.1.0
--------------

pyparted supports new libparted API functions, but those functions are not
yet available in an official release on ftp.gnu.org.  On Fedora systems, the
parted-1.9.0-23 package and later revisions contain the necessary API support.


pyparted-2.0.0
--------------

Complete rewrite of pyparted.  There are now two Python modules exposing the
pyparted API:

    _ped       Low level module interfacing with libparted.
    parted     Higher level module written in Python building on _ped.
