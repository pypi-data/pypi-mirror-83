Description: # GHAU
        Github Auto Update package available to use for all public Github Repositories.
        
        **Currently in development.**
        
        ## Goal
        The goal of this repository is to create a flexible package that can easily be implemented into any python project allowing for automatic updates through GitHub Releases.
        
        Basically I got tired of building update scripts for every program I made.
        ## Features
        - **UPDATE**: Automatically update distributed copies of any public GitHub repository using GitHub Releases.
        - **Clean Directory**: Option to delete certain files before an update is installed.
        - **Whitelist**: Protect certain files from being overwritten by update installation, useful for config files.
        - **Pre-Releases**: Choose to include pre-releases in updates.
        - **Developer Mode detection**: If the package detects a .git folder with files inside, it will automatically abort the update process to protect the file structure during development.
        - **Automatic Reboots**: Optionally reboot into the newer program after update installation. Supports rebooting into a python script, executable, or a custom run command! **Windows not supported.**
        - **Authentication**: Authenticate with the Github API to recieve a larger rate limit and access to your private repositories.
          - Do not store your API token in a public location. Use environmental variables.
        - **Download assets or source code**: Choose between downloading the source code or an uploaded asset!
        ### To-Do
        - Add proper tests (gotta figure out this one)
        - Improve on asset and version detection.
        - Improve developer environment detection.
        - Cleanup & Code Optimization
        ## Installation
        > Does not support Windows!
        
        The package is posted on PyPi, so you can install it using pip, simply run:
        ```
        pip install ghau
        ```
        ## Basic Example
        ```py
        import ghau
        #other imports
        
        update = ghau.Update(version="v0.0.1", repo="InValidFire/ghau")
        update.update()
        # rest of program code
        ```
        ## Documentation (WIP)
        Read the documentation at [Read The Docs](https://ghau.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
        ## Requirements
        This script utilizes [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) for its Github interactions, [wcmatch](https://github.com/facelessuser/wcmatch) for its file filtering, and [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) for file downloads. All three can be found in the requirements.txt file in this repository.
