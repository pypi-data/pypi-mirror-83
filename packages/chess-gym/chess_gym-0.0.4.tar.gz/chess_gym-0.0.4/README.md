`pip install gym`

2. Download and install `gym-chess`: \
`git clone https://github.com/Ryan-Rudes/gym-chess.git` \
`cd gym-chess` \
`python setup.py install` \
 \
 Or, you can use `pip` (you may view the package [here](https://pypi.org/project/chess-gym/)): \

## Environments

## Example
You can use the standard `Chess-v0` environment as so:
```python
import gym
import chess_gym

env = gym.make("Chess-v0")
env.reset()

terminal = False

while not terminal:
  action = env.action_space.sample()
  observation, reward, terminal, info = env.step(action)
  env.render()
  
env.close()
```

There is also an environment for the Chess960 variant; its identifier is `Chess960-v0`

## Further Info
This environment will return 0 reward until the game has reached a terminal state. In the case of a draw, it will still return 0 reward. Otherwise, the reward will be either 1 or -1, depending upon the winning player.
```python
observation, reward, terminal, info = env.step(action)
```
Here, `info` will be a dictionary containing the following information pertaining to the board configuration and game state:
* [`turn`](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html#chess.Board.turn): The side to move (`chess.WHITE` or `chess.BLACK`).
* [`castling_rights`](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html#chess.Board.castling_rights): Bitmask of the rooks with castling rights.
* [`fullmove_number`](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html#chess.Board.fullmove_number): Counts move pairs. Starts at 1 and is incremented after every move of the black side.
* [`halfmove_clock`](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html#chess.Board.halfmove_clock): The number of half-moves since the last capture or pawn move.
* [`promoted`](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html#chess.Board.promoted): A bitmask of pieces that have been promoted.
* [`ep_square`](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html#chess.Board.ep_square): The potential en passant square on the third or sixth rank or `None`.
