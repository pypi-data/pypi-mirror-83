Description: DLSuR: Dynamic light scattering microrheology in Python
        ===========================================
        
        DLSuR is a data analysis package for analyzing the scattering intensity from a dynamic light scattering instrument and deriving the microrheology spectrum in the Python programming language.
        
        
        To use DLSuR, you need to:
        * have data from a dynamic light scattering instrument,
        * save the data in the specific format that is listed in this paper[cite], and
        * be sure to collect data following the methods listed in this paper[cite]
        
        # The DLSuR environment
        
        ## Easy Implementation
        
        The DLSuR method is simple to implement, utilizing just the scattering autocorrelation of embedded particles in a given soft material sample. The methods are split into different ways to analyze and visualize one's data.
        
        By using only the scattering autocorrelation, the methodology of analyzing the mean-squared displacement of embedded particles to derive the frequency-dependent complex modulus becomes much simpler than other microrheology techniques such as video particle tracking.
        
        ## Large Range of Rheological Behavior
        
        DLSuR has the capability of measuring up to six decades in rheological behavior without using time-temperature superposition. This is a major advantage over state-of-the-art rheological techniques such as oscillatory rheometers.

        ### Standard installation (on CPU hardware)
        We strongly recommend running DLSuR in an Anaconda environment, because this simplifies the installation of other
        dependencies. You may install the latest version of DLSuR using the package manager `pip`, which will automatically download
        DLSuR from the Python Package Index (PyPI):
        
        ```
        pip install DLSuR
        ```
        
        Linux and macOS are the two officially supported operating systems.
        
        
        # Installation from source
        
        Assuming the DLSuR source has been downloaded, you may install it by running
        
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Developers can also install Kymatio via:
        
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        # Documentation
        
        The documentation of Kymatio is officially hosted on the [DLSuR](https://dlsur.readthedocs.io/) website.
