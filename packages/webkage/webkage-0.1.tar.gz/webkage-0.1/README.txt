Webkage is a fast and lightweight Python webframework created for my learning purpose only.

It was created with pure Python with no external dependencies.

It is not meant to replace or compete with existing mature Python webframeworks like Flask, Django, Tornado, etc.


Webkage's philosophy is simlilar to those of Golang's http library. It emphasizes flexibility and control.


**It is purely for learning purpose; not too security measures were put in place**
