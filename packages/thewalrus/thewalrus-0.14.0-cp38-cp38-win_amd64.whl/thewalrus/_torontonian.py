        A (array): a np.complex128, square, symmetric array of even dimensions.
        fsum (bool): if ``True``, the `Shewchuck algorithm <https://github.com/achan001/fsum>`_
            for more accurate summation is performed. This can significantly increase

            but no casting to quadruple precision takes place, as the Shewchuck algorithm
