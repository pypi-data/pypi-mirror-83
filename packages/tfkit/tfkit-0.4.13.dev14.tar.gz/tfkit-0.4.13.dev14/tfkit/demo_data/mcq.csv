"Is it wrong to use someone else 's wireless(Wi - Fi ) connection?Just recently , a man was arrested for doing just that . At that time , he was sitting in the street with a laptop and using an unsecured wireless connection to surf the Net . What do you think about this topic?Listen to the following different views on it . For a start , if someone is using your Internet service or downloading , this will affect your speed of access or download limit . Also , it 's bad for Internet service providers . They will suffer in the long run because fewer people will pay for an Internet service if they know they can get it for free . And finally , just imagine this : what if the person who is stealing your Internet connection is involved in an illegal activity?I think the police are totally right to arrest these criminals . --by Sandra Wilkins Basically , if the person who paid for the service still has everything they paid for , what 's the problem?It 's just like using the light from streetlamps to read your book , or watching someone else 's firework display . It 's not stealing . Also , if you leave your wireless connection unsecured , then it is your own fault if someone else uses it . Just as you would n't leave your front door unlocked , or your car door open , neither should you leave your wireless connection open . By leaving your wireless connection open , you are inviting people to use it . Securing your wireless connection is as easy as clicking a few settings on your router .And finally , haven't the police got more important crimes to solve?They're always saying how they have n't got the manpower to solve real issues . But this is just ridiculous . --by James Hoarley </s> In James Hoarley 's opinion ,<mask> using others ' Internet service is not stealing at all<mask> Internet service should be improved .<mask> it is hard to secure one 's wireless connection<mask> it is hard to secure one 's wireless connection .<mask> Internet service should be improved<mask> people should leave their wireless connection open<mask> people should leave their wireless connection open .",1
