# cdk8s

> Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes

**cdk8s** is a software development framework for defining Kubernetes
applications using rich object-oriented APIs. It allows developers to leverage
the full power of software in order to define abstract components called
"constructs" which compose Kubernetes resources or other constructs into
higher-level abstractions.

This library is the foundation of **cdk8s**. It includes base types that are
used to define cdk8s applications.

## Chart

The `Chart` is a container that synthesizes a single Kubernetes manifest.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
class MyChart(Chart):
    def __init__(self, scope, ns):
        super().__init__(scope, ns)
```

During synthesis, charts collect all the `ApiObject` nodes (recursively) and
emit a single YAML manifest that includes all these objects.

When a chart is defined, you can specify chart-level `namespace` and `labels`.
Those will be applied to all API objects defined within the chart (recursively):

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
class MyChart(Chart):
    def __init__(self, scope, ns):
        super().__init__(scope, ns,
            namespace="my-namespace",
            labels={
                "app": "my-app"
            }
        )

        ApiObject(self, "my-object",
            api_version="v1",
            kind="Foo"
        )
```

Will synthesize into:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Foo
metadata:
  namesapce: my-namespace
  labels:
    app: my-app
```

## ApiObject

An `ApiObject` is a construct that represents an entry in a Kubernetes manifest (level 0).
In most cases, you won't use `ApiObject` directly but rather use classes that
are imported through `cdk8s import` and which extend this base class.

## Include

The `Include` construct can be used to include an existing manifest in a chart.

The following example will include the Kubernetes Dashboard in `MyChart`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from cdk8s import Include

class MyChart(Chart):
    def __init__(self, scope, id):
        super().__init__(scope, id)

        dashboard = Include(self, "dashboard", {
            "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml",
            # or
            "url": "dashboard.yaml"
        })
```

All API objects defined in the included manifest will be added as children
`ApiObject`s under the `Include` construct's scope and can be accessed
through the `apiObject` property:

The following example queries for all the `Deployment` resources in the
dashboard:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
deployment_api_object = dashboard.api_objects.find(c => c.kind === 'Deployment);)
```

NOTE: names of included objects (`metadata.name`) are preserved. This means that
if you try to include the same manifest twice into the same chart, your manifest
will have duplicate definitions of the same objects.

## Dependencies

You can declare dependencies between any two cdk8s constructs using the `addDependency()` method.

### ApiObjects

For example, you can force kubernetes to first apply a `Namespace` before applying the `Service` in the scope of that namespace:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
namespace = k8s.Namespace(chart, "backend")
service = k8s.Service(chart, "Service", metadata={"namespace": namespace.name})

# declare the dependency. this is just a syntactic sugar for Node.of(service).addDependency(namespace)
service.add_dependency(namespace)
```

`cdk8s` will ensure that the `Namespace` object is placed before the `Service` object in the resulting manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: chart-backend-a59d2e47
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: chart-service-93d02be7
  namespace: chart-backend-a59d2e47
```

### Charts

You can also specify dependencies between charts, in exactly the same manner. For example, if we have a chart that provisions our `namespace`, we need that chart to be applied first:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
namespace_chart = NamespaceChart(app, "namespace")
application_chart = ApplicationChart(app, "application")

# declare the dependency. this is just a syntactic sugar for Node.of(applicationChart).addDependency(namespaceChart)
application_chart.add_dependency(namespace_chart)
```

Running `cdk8s synth` will produce the following `dist` directory:

```console
> cdk8s synth

dist/0000-namespace.k8s.yaml
dist/0001-application.k8s.yaml
```

Notice that the `namespace` chart appears first with the `0000` prefix. This will ensure that a subsequent execution of `kubectl apply -f dist/` will apply the `namespace` first, and the `application` second.

### Custom Constructs

The behavior above applies in the same way to custom constructs that you create or use.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
class Database(Construct):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)

        k8s.StatefulSet(self, "StatefulSet")
        k8s.ConfigMap(self, "ConfigMap")

app = App()

chart = Chart(app, "Chart")

service = k8s.Service(chart, "Service")
database = Database(chart, "Database")

service.add_dependency(database)
```

Declaring such a dependency will cause **each** `ApiObject` in the source construct, to *depend on* **every** `ApiObject` in the target construct.

Note that in the example above, the source construct is actually an `ApiObject`, which is also ok since it is essentially a construct with a single `ApiObject`.

> Note that if the source of your dependency is a custom construct, it won't have the `addDependency` syntactic sugar by default, so you'll have to use `Node.of()`.

The resulting manifest will be:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: chart-database-statefulset-4627f8e2
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: chart-database-configmap-676f8640
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: chart-service-93d02be7
```

You can see that all `ApiObject`s of the `Database` construct, appear before the `Service` object.

### Things just got cool

If you simply declare a dependency between two `ApiObject`s (or `Constructs`), that belong to two different `Chart`s, `cdk8s` will create the chart dependency automatically for you.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
namespace_chart = NamespaceChart(app, "namespace")
application_chart = ApplicationChart(app, "application")

namespace = k8s.Namespace(namespace_chart, "namespace")
deployment = k8s.Deployment(application_chart, "Deployment")

# dependency between ApiObjects, not Charts!
deployment.add_dependency(namespace)
```

Running `cdk8s synth` will produce the same result as if explicit chart dependencies were declared:

```console
> cdk8s synth

dist/0000-namespace.k8s.yaml
dist/0001-application.k8s.yaml
```

This means you need not be bothered with managing chart dependencies, simply work with the `ApiObject`s you create, and let `cdk8s` infer the chart dependencies.

## Helm Support

You can use the `Helm` construct in order to include [Helm](https://helm.sh)
charts.

In order to use this construct, you must have `helm` installed on your system.
See [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) in the Helm
documentation for details.

The following example adds the
[bitnami/redis](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis)
Helm chart with sentinel containers enabled:

> The Bitnami helm repo needs to be added through: `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
class MyChart(cdk8s.Chart):
    def __init__(self, scope, id):
        super().__init__(scope, id)

        redis = Helm(self, "redis",
            chart="bitnami/redis",
            values={
                "sentinel": {
                    "enabled": True
                }
            }
        )
```

The `Helm` construct will render the manifest from the specified chart by
executing `helm template`. If `values` is specified, these values will override
the default values included with the chart.

The `name` option can be used to specify the chart's [release name](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#three-big-concepts).
If not specified, a valid and unique release name will be allocated
based on the construct path.

The `Helm` construct extends `Include` and inherits it's API. For example, you
can use the `apiObjects` property to find and interact with included API
objects.

The following example shows how to add an annotation to the Redis master
deployment:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
master = redis.api_objects.find(o => o.name === 'foo-redis-master);,
    master.metadata.add_annotation("my.annotation", "hey-there"))
```

## Testing

cdk8s bundles a set of test utilities under the `Testing` class:

* `Testing.app()` returns an `App` object bound to a temporary output directory.
* `Testing.chart()` returns a `Chart` object bound to a testing app.
* `Testing.synth(chart)` returns the Kubernetes manifest synthesized from a
  chart.
