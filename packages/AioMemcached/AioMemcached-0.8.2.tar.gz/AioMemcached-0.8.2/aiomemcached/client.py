    Storage commands
    ----------------

    First, the client sends a command line which looks like this:

    <command name> <key> <flags> <exptime> <bytes> [noreply]\r\n
    cas <key> <flags> <exptime> <bytes> <cas unique> [noreply]\r\n

    - <command name> is "set", "add", "replace", "append" or "prepend"

      "set" means "store this data".

      "add" means "store this data, but only if the server *doesn't* already
      hold data for this key".

      "replace" means "store this data, but only if the server *does*
      already hold data for this key".

      "append" means "add this data to an existing key after existing data".

      "prepend" means "add this data to an existing key before existing data".

      The append and prepend commands do not accept flags or exptime.
      They update existing data portions, and ignore new flag and exptime
      settings.

      "cas" is a check and set operation which means "store this data but
      only if no one else has updated since I last fetched it."

    - <key> is the key under which the client asks to store the data

    - <flags> is an arbitrary 16-bit unsigned integer (written out in
      decimal) that the server stores along with the data and sends back
      when the item is retrieved. Clients may use this as a bit field to
      store data-specific information; this field is opaque to the server.
      Note that in memcached 1.2.1 and higher, flags may be 32-bits, instead
      of 16, but you might want to restrict yourself to 16 bits for
      compatibility with older versions.

    - <exptime> is expiration time. If it's 0, the item never expires
      (although it may be deleted from the cache to make place for other
      items). If it's non-zero (either Unix time or offset in seconds from
      current time), it is guaranteed that clients will not be able to
      retrieve this item after the expiration time arrives (measured by
      server time). If a negative value is given the item is immediately
      expired.

    - <bytes> is the number of bytes in the data block to follow, *not*
      including the delimiting \r\n. <bytes> may be zero (in which case
      it's followed by an empty data block).

    - <cas unique> is a unique 64-bit value of an existing entry.
      Clients should use the value returned from the "gets" command
      when issuing "cas" updates.

    - "noreply" optional parameter instructs the server to not send the
      reply.  NOTE: if the request line is malformed, the server can't
      parse "noreply" option reliably.  In this case it may send the error
      to the client, and not reading it on the client side will break
      things.  Client should construct only valid requests.

    After this line, the client sends the data block:

    <data block>\r\n

    - <data block> is a chunk of arbitrary 8-bit data of length <bytes>
      from the previous line.

    After sending the command line and the data block the client awaits
    the reply, which may be:

    - "STORED\r\n", to indicate success.

    - "NOT_STORED\r\n" to indicate the data was not stored, but not
    because of an error. This normally means that the
    condition for an "add" or a "replace" command wasn't met.

    - "EXISTS\r\n" to indicate that the item you are trying to store with
    a "cas" command has been modified since you last fetched it.

    - "NOT_FOUND\r\n" to indicate that the item you are trying to store
    with a "cas" command did not exist.

        - <key>* means one or more key strings separated by whitespace.

        Increment/Decrement
        -------------------

        Commands "incr" and "decr" are used to change data for some item
        in-place, incrementing or decrementing it. The data for the item is
        treated as decimal representation of a 64-bit unsigned integer.  If
        the current data value does not conform to such a representation, the
        incr/decr commands return an error (memcached <= 1.2.6 treated the
        bogus value as if it were 0, leading to confusion). Also, the item
        must already exist for incr/decr to work; these commands won't pretend
        that a non-existent key exists with value 0; instead, they will fail.

        The client sends the command line:

        incr <key> <value> [noreply]\r\n

        or

        decr <key> <value> [noreply]\r\n

        - <key> is the key of the item the client wishes to change

        - <value> is the amount by which the client wants to increase/decrease
        the item. It is a decimal representation of a 64-bit unsigned integer.

        - "noreply" optional parameter instructs the server to not send the
          reply.  See the note in Storage commands regarding malformed
          requests.

        The response will be one of:

        - "NOT_FOUND\r\n" to indicate the item with this value was not found

        - <value>\r\n , where <value> is the new value of the item's data,
          after the increment/decrement operation was carried out.

        Note that underflow in the "decr" command is caught: if a client tries
        to decrease the value below 0, the new value will be 0.  Overflow in
        the "incr" command will wrap around the 64 bit mark.

        Note also that decrementing a number such that it loses length isn't
        guaranteed to decrement its returned length.  The number MAY be
        space-padded at the end, but this is purely an implementation
        optimization, so you also shouldn't rely on that.

Touch
-----

The "touch" command is used to update the expiration time of an existing item

- <exptime> is expiration time. Works the same as with the update commands

  expiration time of "20", the item would then expire in 20 seconds.

  requests.
