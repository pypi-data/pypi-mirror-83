Description: # simprad
        _Simplify radicals._
        
        Simplifies a radical into a multiple of the square root of a prime number.
        Based on the popular SIMPRAD for TI-BASIC of unknown author.
        Supports negative numbers and arbitrary roots.
        
        When the input is a nonnegative number, the output will be a Tuple of two
        real numbers&#2014;the coefficient and the radicand.  
        When the input is a negative number, the output will be a Tuple of a complex
        coefficient and a real radicand.
        
        Use simprad as a module:
        ```py
        from simprad import simprad
        
        print(simprad(50))    # (5, 2)
        print(simprad(36))    # (6, 1)
        print(simprad(-50))   # (5j, 2)
        print(simprad(8, 3))  # (2, 1)
        ```
        
        Use simprad as a command line utility:
        <!-- Unicode characters don't work in ```code blocks```, so I'm using <pre> instead as a workaround -->
        <pre>
        $ python -m simprad
        Radical to simplify: &#x221A;50
        Root [2]: 2
        5 &#x00D7; &#x221A;2
        </pre>
