``filter-profanity`` is one of the most efficient python packages that provides functionality to censor profanity in text! The package cross-verifies text with a list of opensource profane vocabulary that you can find [here](https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words).

This package can be used in many areas including chat applications, bots and anything that handles user input!

## Installation
Installing ``filter-profanity`` is as easy as running ``pip install filter-profanity``!

## Usage
We've developed ``filter-profanity`` to make it as easy as possible to utilize.

Currently, ``filter-profanity`` provides three functions - ``censor_profanity``, ``has_profanity`` and ``get_profanity``

``censor_profanity(text, optional_censor)`` takes in two arguments, the text that it scans for profanity and an optional censor to replace profane language with. If you do not provide a censor, we default to ``*``. Here's an example -
```
from profanity import censor_profanity

print(censor_profanity("This code is definitely not sh!t"))
# Prints -
# This code is definitely not ****
```

``has_profanity(text)`` takes in one argument- the text that it must check for profanity. If the provided text has any profane content, it returns ``True`` otherwise it conditionally returns ``False``. Here's an example -
```
from profanity import has_profanity

print(has_profanity("This code is definitely not sh!t"))
# Prints -
# True
```

``get_profanity(text, duplicates=False)`` takes two arguments - the text to return profanity from, and a boolean specifying if it should return duplicate words or not (defaults to False). If the text has any profane content, it returns a list with detected words, otherwise it returns an empty list. Here's an example -
```
from profanity import get_profanity

print(get_profanity("This code is definitely not sh!t sh!t"))
# Prints -
# ['sh!t']
```
