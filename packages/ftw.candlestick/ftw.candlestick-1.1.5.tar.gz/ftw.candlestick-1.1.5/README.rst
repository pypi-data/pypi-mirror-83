Introduction
============

The name **candlestick** comes from the times when the telephone had just been invented.
One of the first models of a telephone was a stick which was placed on a table where the speaker
could talk into it.

This module provides a javascript library to automatically generate phone links.
A treeWalker walks through the whole DOM and collects all :code:`textNodes`. If a node
matches a phone number the number will be replaced with a :code:`<a href="tel:phonenumber">Your phonenumber</a>`
link. Existing links or input fields are not affected.

By default the `candlestick.integration.js` is loaded which converts all phone numbers in the `body`.
