Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The name **candlestick** comes from the times when the telephone had just been invented.
        One of the first models of a telephone was a stick which was placed on a table where the speaker
        could talk into it.

        This module provides a javascript library to automatically generate phone links.
        A treeWalker walks through the whole DOM and collects all :code:`textNodes`. If a node
        matches a phone number the number will be replaced with a :code:`<a href="tel:phonenumber">Your phonenumber</a>`
        link. Existing links or input fields are not affected.
        
        By default the `candlestick.integration.js` is loaded which converts all phone numbers in the `body`.

        Client library
        ==============
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        The client library depends on `Grunt <http://gruntjs.com/>`_. Assuming
        you already have **Node.js** installed on your system, run the following command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          sudo npm install -g grunt
        
        To install the dependencies, run the following command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          npm install
        
        And with **npm** you get the following packages:
        
        - `Grunt <http://gruntjs.com/>`_ - JavaScript task runner.
        - `Babel <https://babeljs.io/>`_ - ES6 Transpiler.
        - `Browserify <http://browserify.org/>`_ - Dependency Bundler
        - `Karma <http://karma-runner.github.io/>`_ - JavaScript test runner.
        - `Jasmine <http://jasmine.github.io/>`_ - JavaScript test suite.
        - `Chai <http://chaijs.com/>`_ - JavaScript Assertion Library.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Run the following command to re-build the library:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          grunt build
        
        Run the following command to watch for changes which trigger a rebuild:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          grunt
        
        Build options
        -------------
        
        See https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook for more information about browserify.
        
        Source Maps
        -----------
        
        Browserify comes with a built-in support to generate source maps. It is already enabled by default, but feel free to disable source maps. Refer to `this article <https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/javascript-debugging#source-maps>`_
        to enable source maps in Google Chrome, if you haven't already done so.
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        Run all tests
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          grunt test
        
        Run a specific test
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          grunt test --grep="Name of your test"
        
        Initialization
        --------------
        
        Converts all phone numbers to links
        
        .. code:: javascript
