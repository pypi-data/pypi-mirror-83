        vdz.plone.projectreview
        =======================
        
        This Plone_ add-on has been developed by `visaplan GmbH`_, Bochum, Germany
        for `VDZ Technology gGmbH`_, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, to evaluate projects.
        
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        This add-on is currently under development and not yet used on public internet
        sites.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Sorry, we don't have real user documentation yet.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        These instructions assume you have shell access to the server which will run
        the your Plone instance and moderate shell using skills.
        
        
        Install Plone
        -------------
        
        The vdz.plone.projectreview package is an add-on for the open-source content
        management system Plone_, which in turn is based on the web application server
        Zope_.
        
        Currently, vdz.plone.projectreview still needs Plone 4.3;
        see `Issue 1, "Plone 5 support"`.
        
        If you don't have a suitable Plone installation yet,
        you can use the `Unified Installer`_.
        Install a recent 4.3 version.
        
        At the time of this writing, the latest release
        provided via UnifiedInstaller is 4.3.19,
        but 4.3.20 is `soft released`_ and ready for production use.
        
        We need to apply a few little changes to your buildout script, typically named
        ``buildout.cfg``; thus, don't run ``buildout`` immediately
        (unless you want to do it twice).
        
        *Please note:*
        
        A vanilla Plone 4.3.19 most likely *won't work* because of the broken
        ``main_template.pt`` it contains.  So, if you get an ugly little error text
        about a compilation error when trying to access the web interface
        *(or just to have the most recent version)*,
        please update to Plone 4.3.20 (which is expected to be the last 4.3 release),
        by replacing e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                ...
                versions.cfg
        
        by::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                ...
                https://dist.plone.org/release/4.3.20/versions.cfg
        
        If you already have a running Plone 4.3.19, you probably use an alternative
        ``main_template.pt`` already (as we'll do as well, using plonetheme.bootstrap_),
        and may continue to do so.
        
        You are encouraged to update, of course, but there is not technical requirement
        to do so for vdz.plone.projectreview.
        
        
        Use an existing Plone 4 installation
        ------------------------------------
        
        If you have an existing Plone 4 installation, you might be able to use it.
        There are a few things to consider:
        
        - Since we use plonetheme.bootstrap_, the global `main_template` is overridden.
          If you rely on another `main_template`, this probably won't work.
        
        - We use Bootstrap 3 styles.
        
        - We use jQuery_ 1.11 (or higher).  If you have incompatible custom Javascript
          which needs an older version (e.g. using the old ``.live`` and ``.die`` API
          which was removed in jQuery 1.9+), you'll need to install a compatibility
          layer or `update your scripts`_.
        
        The rule is:
        
        - If you are fine with the product activations needed for
          vdz.plone.projectreview `and` with the package versions, you can use your
          existing Plone instance.
        
        - If our product activations don't match your needs,
          but the package versions do
          (e.g. you can live with plone.app.jquery_ being v1.11.2
          and a 4.3.* Products.CMFPlone_ version),
          you should be able to use your existing Zope_ installation
          and create a new Plone site in it, with an id of your choice.
        
        *Please test* the coexistence of your current site with vdz.plone.projectreview
        in a dedicated test environment!
        
        
        Add vdz.plone.projectreview
        ---------------------------
        
        First, the vdz.plone.projectreview package must be added to the ``eggs`` value;
        the Unified Installer puts this in the ``[buildout]`` section::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                Plone
                vdz.plone.projectreview
        
        Since we use a relational database, you'll need a database driver as well.
        Our package pulls in SQLAlchemy_ (via zope.sqlalchemy_) itself,
        but you'll need a specific driver for your database.
        For PostgreSQL, this might be psycopg2_::
        
            eggs =
                ...
                vdz.plone.projectreview
                psycopg2
        
        
        Version pinnings
        ----------------
        
        Since we use Bootstrap 3, we need jQuery 1.11+.
        Plone 4.3 by default still uses jQuery 1.7, for historical reasons.
        
        Your ``buildout.cfg`` script `extends` other scripts, containing version
        pinnings. Find or create the ``[versions]`` section in ``buildout.cfg`` and
        override the 1.7.* value::
        
            [versions]
            ...
            plone.app.jquery_ = 1.11.2
        
        
        Product configuration
        ---------------------
        
        There are two configuration settings which are done in the buildout:
        
        1. the `data source name`_, specifying the relational database;
        2. a directory path for file attachments.
        
        For these, we'll create additional text for the ``zope.conf``
        file(s) of your Zope instance part(s).
        
        You might want to put these settings in a dedicated ``settings.cfg`` file and
        add this to the `extends` list.
        The Unified Installer uses the ``[buildout]`` section::
        
            [buildout]
            zope-conf-additional =
                <product-config projectreview>
                data-dir ${buildout:directory}/var/myattachmentsdir
                </product-config>
                <product-config reldb>
                dsn      postgresql+psycopg2://localhost/mydb
                </product-config>
        
        In this case, you'll need to make sure this value is used for your instance
        parts, e.g. in ``base.cfg``::
        
            [instance_base]
            ...
            zope-conf-additional = ${buildout:zope-conf-additional}
        
        
        Build and start
        ---------------
        
        With everything in place, run ``bin/buildout``.
        
        If you didn't specify an own administration password, be sure you have it in
        the buildout, or to write it down;
        you'll need it to login to your fresh Zope instance and create the "real"
        users.
        
        Start up the instance (depending on the type of your installation), e.g.::
        
             bin/instance fg
        
        
        Database initialization
        -----------------------
        
        (TODO; script needed)
        
        
        Product installations
        ---------------------
        
        In the `prefs_install_products_form` view of your instance, we'll activate the
        following extensions (if not already done):
        
        - vdz.plone.projectreview
        - Bootstrap Theme
        - jQuery DataTables
        - jQuery UI
        
        We'll deactivate:
        
        - Classic Plone design
        
        
        Update to Plone 5
        -----------------
        
        Finally, a few remarks considering Plone 5.
        
        Most of the parts are Plone-5- and Python-3-ready already,
        so there might be an update soon.
        
        However, all `projects data` is held in a relational database anyway, so
        it should be possible to use this in a fresh installation without any necessary
        data migration, just using the same `data source name`_.
        
        The only thing which would need to be migrated (in the standard case) is the
        user and groups information; this is beyond the scope of this documentation.
        In most cases, this involves so few user accounts and groups
        that it can be done by hand easily.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        - Products.CMFPlone_:
        
          This is "the Plone" we use.
        
          - Currently we require a 4.3 version.
        
          - Version 4.3.19 is `broken`
            regarding the contained ``main_template.pt`` skin layer template;
            thus, a vanilla Plone 4.3.19 (e.g. for fresh installations)
            most likely won't work.
            Since this template is frequently overridden, this is not a hard
            requirement;
            in case of problems, please follow the instructions above
            to upgrade to release 4.3.20.
        
        - Python 2.7:
        
          Because Plone 4.3 requires Python 2.7, so do we (for the moment).
          Our Python code should support Python 3 already, using the six_ library.
