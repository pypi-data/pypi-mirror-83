# datup                                                   

## How is it work?
    import datup as dt

## To Instance the Class
    ins = dt.Datup("aws_acces_key_id","aws_secret_access_key","datalake")

## Is necessary invoke all time the instance object?
Yes, is necessary invoke all time the instance object since, the functions must
write in /tmp/ log file as default. In documentation will find how to use the class
and change default values.

## Example of a method with the callable instance
    dt.check_data_format(ins,dataframe)

## Can I test my updates?
Yes, there is a file called _testing.ipynb where you can test your changes. The variables, 
must be initialized always for modularity.

## Where can I find some documentation?
You can find the documentation in the next address: http://18.234.95.22/
Documentation as the library is on beta mode, for that reason write to cristhianpo@datup.ai for
whatever bug
