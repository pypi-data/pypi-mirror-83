        ## Releasing to PyPi and Test PyPi
        
        For now, we release without a Gitlab CI. We should create that soon though. In the `Makefile`, there are two commands:
        - `make release`: release to prod PyPi
        - `make release-test`: release to test PyPi
        
        When running either commands, you're prompted for a username and password. We're not using the actual username and password, but an API token (see LastPass for users PyPi and Test PyPi, as well as the release/prod API token). When using an API token, fill out the following:
        - `username` = `__token__`
        - `password` = `<api_token>` (including `pypi-` part)
