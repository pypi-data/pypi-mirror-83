Description: psh allows you to spawn processes in Unix shell-style way.
        
        Unix shell is very convenient for spawning processes, connecting them into
        pipes, etc., but it has a very limited language which is often not suitable
        for writing complex programs. Python is a very flexible and reach language
        which is used in a wide variety of application domains, but its standard
        subprocess module is very limited. psh combines the power of Python language
        and an elegant shell-style way to execute processes.
