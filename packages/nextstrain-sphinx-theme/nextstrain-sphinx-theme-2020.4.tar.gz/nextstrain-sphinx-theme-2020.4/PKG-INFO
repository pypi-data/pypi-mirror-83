Description: sphinx-nextstrain-theme
        =======================
        
        A `Sphinx theme`_ for Nextstrain's documentation, based on `Read The Docs`_'
        default theme (sphinx_rtd_theme_).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This theme is distributed on PyPI as nextstrain-sphinx-theme_ and can be
        installed with ``pip``:
        
        .. code:: console
        
            $ python3 -m pip install nextstrain-sphinx-theme
        
        To use the theme in your Sphinx project, you will need to add the following to
        your ``conf.py`` file:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"
        
        This theme is based on sphinx_rtd_theme_ and accepts all of the same
        `configuration options`_ settable via ``html_theme_option``.  One additional
        option is supported:
        
        :logo: Boolean determining if the Nextstrain logo should be displayed.
               Defaults to true.
        
        If your project wants to display its own logo, just set Sphinx's ``html_logo``
        to point to the image file in your Sphinx project.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            html_logo = "_static/your-logo.png"
        
        This will automatically take precedence over the default Nextstrain logo
        provided by the theme.
