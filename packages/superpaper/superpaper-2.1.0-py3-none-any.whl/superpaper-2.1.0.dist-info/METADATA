## Installation

### Linux

The AppImage will run once you make it executable.

 For native, and other, installation options head over to: [installing on linux](./docs/installation-linux.md). System theme and icon integration can be better on the native (PyPI) installation.

### Windows 10

 A Windows installer and a portable package are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/hhannine/superpaper/releases).

### Mac OS X

 You must install the dependencies and run the project, see [development-macos](./docs/development-macos.md).


## Usage

You can either:

- Open Superpaper as a graphical application
  - First run opens help and wallpaper settings. Disable 'show help at start' to run Superpaper silently in the background.
  - Control Superpaper in the background from the tray menu or with hotkeys.
- Call it from the [command-line](./docs/cli-usage.md)
  - Perspectives cannot be configured or used through the CLI currently.


## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues and Superpaper closes unexpectedly, you can either:
- Enable logging in the Settings.
- Manually enable logging in the 'general_settings' file by setting 'logging=true'.
- Run Superpaper from the command-line with the switch '--debug' to get debugging prints.
```sh
superpaper --debug
#or
./Superpaper-2.0.2-x86_64.AppImage --debug
```
Check the logs and come create an issue!
