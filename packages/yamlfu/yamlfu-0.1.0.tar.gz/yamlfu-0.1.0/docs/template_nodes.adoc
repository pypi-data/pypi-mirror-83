=== Template Nodes

Templated nodes can be used to render nodes that need to be reproduced multiple with custom variables. Template nodes must be dictionaries, and they must have an `_arguments` field with a (csv) string representing the fields required to render a template instance.

In order to render a template, the special _render()_ function is available within the python runtime. It must be invoked with the template name as the first argument, followed by the template arguments.

The next example illustrates the generation of multiple documents using a list for the `kind` argument.
