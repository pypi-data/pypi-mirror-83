    This finds the Constants of the CO2 system in seawater or freshwater,
    corrects them for pressure, and reports them on the chosen pH scale.
    The process is as follows: the Constants (except KS, KF which stay on the
    free scale - these are only corrected for pressure) are:
          1) evaluated as they are given in the literature,
          2) converted to the SWS scale in mol/kg-SW or to the NBS scale,
          3) corrected for pressure,
          4) converted to the SWS pH scale in mol/kg-SW,
          5) converted to the chosen pH scale.
