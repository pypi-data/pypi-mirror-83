Description: # OpenhabWebThingPushGateway
        A push gateway sending webthing properties updates to a openhab server
        
        This project provides a background service connecting [webthing API](https://iot.mozilla.org/wot/)-based devices such as windsensors or motion detector to the [Openhab](https://www.openhab.org/) automation system. 
        
        Internally, the service uses the web socket notification capability of the webthing api to listen for changes. If a webthing property is updated, the service will use the REST api of the Openhab installation 
        to update the assoiciated Openhab item.
        
        For each link (webthing property <-> openhab item association) an entry in a gateway config file has to be placed. E.g. a concrete config file may look like
        ```
        # webthing_root_uri, webthing_property_name, openhab_root_uri, openhab_item_name
        http://192.168.1.21:9131/, temperature, http://192.168.1.12:8080, TempCurrent
        http://192.168.1.21:9132/, windspeed, http://192.168.1.12:8080, WindspeedCurrent
        http://192.168.1.187:9045/, motion, http://192.168.1.12:8080, MotionGroundfloor
        ```
        The first entry is the webthing endpoint uri, the second the property name to be linked. 
        The third parameter is the endpoint uri of the openhab installation, and the fourth parameter is the item name 
        (which may differ from the webthing property name)      
        
        To service can be started manually via command line using
        ```
        sudo pushgateway --command listen --filename /etc/pushgateway/gateway.conf
        ```
         
        Alternatively to the *listen* command, you can use the *register* command to register and start the service as systemd unit. 
        By doing this the service will be started automatically on boot. Starting the server manually using the *listen* command is no longer necessary. 
        ```
        sudo pushgateway --command register --filename /etc/pushgateway/gateway.conf
        ```  
        
        To install this software you may use [PIP](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/) package manager such as shown below
        ```
        sudo pip install pushgateway
        ```
