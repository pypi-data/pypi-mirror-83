Sync Ends is an automated bridge to sync service owners and service consumers. Every team has a single postman collection that they use to test their APIs and share it across in their documentations. The backend team has to register their service on our application and we take care of the rest. Everytime there is a change in the way the api is called, we parse the changes and inform the consumers. This way all the team members are informed about the changes and know exactly what to edit in their product. The [Slack](https://slack.com/) framework lets you concentrate on the `core` functionality you want to build without worrying about integration overheads.

## Setup

### Postman
1. Sign in to [Postman](https://identity.getpostman.com/login)
2. If you do not have any pre-exiting collections on Postman, import this sample [collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/dfa93d217bf211237c8f)
3. To integrate with the Sync Ends service, a Postman API key is required. Generate API key by visiting this [page](https://web.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys)
4. Copy the generated API key. This is required during the time of execution

### Create a slack team and slackbot(You can skip this section if you already have a slack bot API token)

Follow the below steps to create a slack team and then a slack bot. You can skip this step if you already have a team and are the admin.

### Creating Slack team
1. Open https://slack.com/
2. Provide your email ID. Select Create New workspace.
3. Check your email and enter the code to verify your email.
4. Provide your name and set a password
5. Add some details to your team in the next page
6. Provide a company name
7. Team URL should be unique - Also remember this URL - this is what is used to login to your slack instance
8. Agree with the terms
9. Skip the invite step
10. You are up and running with your own instance of Slack.

Now that team is created, let us create a slack bot

### Creating Slack bot
1. Open your {team-URL}/apps (the one you created above). Ex: https://test-visual.slack.com/apps
2. Search for bot in the search bar and select `bots`
3. In the bots landing page click on Add configuration
4. Provide a bot name. Ex: wolfpack-bot and click on Add Bot integration
5. In the Setup instruction page: `Copy and store the API Token`. Ex: xoxb-22672546-n1X9APk3D0tfksr81NJj6VAM
6. Save the integration

# Execution

In line #133 of src/sync_ends_service.py, replace `<slackbot token>` with your bot token after bot creation: [Creating Slack Bot](https://github.com/varsha5595/csc510-project/wiki)

```
cd src
python3 sync_ends_service.py
```
