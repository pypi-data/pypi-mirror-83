Description: 
                SCDATA - Module for analysis of air quality data using sensors
                scdata is a framework built with the purpose of *analysis*, *calibration* 
                and *post-processing* of sensors data, related to any field, but particularly 
                focused on air-quality data coming from low-cost sensors. 
                It aims to unify several sources of data and to provide tools for analysing data by:
                * Interacting with several sensors APIs (see [here](scdata/data/api.py))
                * Clean data, export and calculate metrics
                * Model sensor data and calibrate sensors
                * Generate data visualisations:
