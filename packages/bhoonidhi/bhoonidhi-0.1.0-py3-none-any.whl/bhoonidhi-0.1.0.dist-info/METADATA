# bhoonidhi
A Python library for Bhoonidhi, ISRO's Open data access portal (https:/bhoonidhi.nrsc.gov.in). The current version contains AI helper called "smart search" using NLP. The functionality can enable the power of searching in bhoonidhi using common search sentences and fetch the bhoonidhi results.

## Installation (https://pypi.org/project/bhoonidhi/0.1.0/)
```
pip install bhoonidhi
```

## Importing and using the module
```
from bhoonidhi.SmartSearch import bhoonidhiSmartSearch

user_query = "Get me Landsat 8 data from the region of hyderabad and Guntur from the last 1 month"
bhoonidhiResponse = bhoonidhiSmartSearch(user_query)
```

## Smart search for Event Based
```
from bhoonidhi.SmartSearch import bhoonidhiSmartSearch

user_query = "Get me available data from siachen avalanche and kerala floods 2020"
bhoonidhiResponse = bhoonidhiSmartSearch(user_query)
```

## Multiple query parameters
```
from bhoonidhi.SmartSearch import bhoonidhiSmartSearch

user_query = "I want Landsat8 and Sentinel 2A data from the region of Guntur over the radius of 20 km and cloud threshold of 35%"
bhoonidhiResponse = bhoonidhiSmartSearch(user_query)
```
Downloading a product requires a valid login from bhoonidhi or uops. For free registration visit https://uops.nrsc.gov.in/ImgeosUops/FinalImgeosUops/OdapUserRegister.html 
## Download a single product from the searched products
```
from bhoonidhi.SmartSearch import bhoonidhiSmartSearch
from bhoonidhi.SmartSearch import bhoonidhiDownload

user_query = "I want Landsat8 and Sentinel 2A data from the region of Guntur over the radius of 20 km and cloud threshold of 35%"
bhoonidhiProducts = bhoonidhiSmartSearch(user_query)
# Want to download the 12th product from the response, pass the 12th response product object
bhoonidhiDownload(bhoonidhiProducts[12],user_id='bhoonidhi_user', password='password', output_path='D:\\bhoonidhiDownloads')
```

## Bulk Download searched products (Batch downloading with custom number of concurrent/parallel downloads [maximum limit of 5 by https:/bhoonidhi.nrsc.gov.in])
```
from bhoonidhi.SmartSearch import bhoonidhiSmartSearch
from bhoonidhi.SmartSearch import bhoonidhiBatchDownload

user_query = "I want Landsat8 and Sentinel 2A data from the region of Guntur over the radius of 20 km and cloud threshold of 35%"
bhoonidhiProducts = bhoonidhiSmartSearch(user_query)
# Want to download all (maximum downloads allowed by website is 5)
bhoonidhiBatchDownload(bhoonidhiProducts,user_id='bhoonidhi_user', password='password', parallelDownloads=5, output_path='D:\\bhoonidhiDownloads')
```

The module fetches the results seperately and concatenates the results in a list format. 

One can download products easily from this library.
This module shall be enabled for bhoondihiAPI which is currently under construction. Thematic based search, on-demand-LULC classification module libraries shall be released soon.
