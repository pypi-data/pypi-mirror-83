        Generic METAL_ macros for input fields
        
        This package uses the TAL_ / METAL_ XML-based template language introduced by
        Zope_ to provide simple input fields from Python dictionaries,
        without any connection to schema data whatsoever.
        
        The fields (or, more precisely: field sets) are created with classes for the
        Bootstrap_ grid layout system.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Input elements for `Horizontal forms`_
        - `readonly` fields
        - `required` fields
        - labels
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        This add-on is currently under development and not yet used on public internet
        sites.
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        After installing, you may try the view
        
        - formfields_div_
        
        in your Zope instance; the macros are "self-documenting".
        
        *Note:* Currently it helps to understand German;
        this view is not (yet?) internationalized.
        
        The macros, however, are language-agnostic;
        the don't provide any texts by themselves but use what you throw at them.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you use the macros in your own Plone add-on, add it to the dependencies,
        e.g. in the setup.py file::
        
            setup(...,
                install_requires=[
                    ...,
                    'visaplan.zope.inputmacros',
                    ],
                ...)
        
        
        Or install ``visaplan.zope.inputmacros`` by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                visaplan.zope.inputmacros
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - You'll need a language interpreter as well; this will be given in default
          Zope / Plone installations.
          We don't specify this here to allow you to choose your own.
        
          Starting with Plone 5, Chameleon_ with the z3c.pt_ compatiblily layer is used;
          this should work as well.
        
        - To make use of the classes applied to the HTML elements, you'll need
          `Bootstrap 3`_; you may use
        
          - collective.js.bootstrap_,
            perhaps via
          - plonetheme.bootstrap_.
        
          Bootstrap 4 might work as well, but we didn't try (yet).
        
        - The use of Bootstrap 3 implies the need for jQuery 1.11.2;
          with Plone 4, you'd probably use plone.app.jquery_ 1.11.2+.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        1.3.0 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        - Bootstrap 3 version
          [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.0 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        - Bootstrap 2 version
        
          When developed in the first place (and not yet released as a
          distributable package), the macros had been used with Bootstrap 2.
          Thus, it would be possible to create a Bootstrap-2-based release;
          but it is not very likely this to be done.
