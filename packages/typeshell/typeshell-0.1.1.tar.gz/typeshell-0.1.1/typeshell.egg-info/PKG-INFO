        ## Description
        typeshell-cli is a Python command-line-interface tool that was written as a proof-of-concept of [pytyper](https://github.com/greysonDEV/pytyper), a Python typing test package.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install typeshell
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        #### Basic Usage
        ```
        typeshell [-h] [-V] [-v] create count {proverbs, shakespeare}
        ```
        
        #### Positional Arguments
        ```
        create                 create typing session
        count                  number of prompts in session
        {proverbs, shakespeare}
                               type of prompts in session
        ```
        
        #### Optional Arguments
        ```
        -h, --help             show this help message and exit
        -V, --version          show program version
        -v, --verbose          increase output verbosity
        ```
        
        #### Examples
        
        To create a typing session with 3 proverbs:
        ```
        typeshell create 3 proverbs
        ```
        
        A confirmation input is needed before the typing session begins:
        ```
        *-------[Generating session]-------*
                      Prompts:              
                         3                  
                       Type:                
                      proverbs              
        *------[Press enter to begin]------*
        ```
        
        When the session begins, the shell window will be cleared, only displaying the prompt and space for an input:
        
        ```
        Grief divided is made lighter.
        
        ```
        
        Be aware, the timer starts immediately after pressing enter. To exit the current session, stop the shell processes via `KeyboardInterrupt`.
        
        #### Output
        
        Upon finishing a session, the average statistics for that session will be visible:
        ```
        *-------[Finished session]-------*
        Average statistics:
        
        Gross-WPM: 71.978
        Net-WPM  : 58.446
        Accuracy : 0.95
        Errors   : 2.334
        Time     : 8.102
        *----------------------------------*
        ```
        
        Specifying `--verbose` when creating a typing session will provide an output of each prompt with the user's input, along with an additional line which indicates the errors in the user's input.
        ```
        > Grief divided is made lighter.
        $ Grief divided is made lighter.
