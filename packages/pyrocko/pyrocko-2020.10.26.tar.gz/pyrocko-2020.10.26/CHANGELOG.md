# Changelog

All notable changes to Pyrocko will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

*empty*

## [2020.10.26]

### Fixed
- Fix errors with corrupt WADL returned by GEONET FDSN web service.
- Fix cake crashes related to the `--distances` argument on newer
  NumPy/Python3.8.

### Changed
- Changed default of `demean` argument to `Trace.transfer` from `False` to
  `True`, to be consistent with the behaviour before the introduction of that
  flag.

## [2020.10.08]

### Added
- Support for rotational seismograms in GF stores and Fomosto QSSP2017 backend.
- Trace objects now support serialization to YAML and inclusion into Guts based
  objects.

### Fixed
- Fix incorrect conversion from displacement to velocity and acceleration in
  seismogram synthesis in `pyrocko.gf`. The problem occured when
  `quantity='velocity'` was selected in a `pyrocko.gf.Target` with a GF store
  with `stored_quantity='displacement'`. The returned amplitudes were incorrect
  except for the case of 1 Hz GFs.

### Changed
- Installation of prerequisites is now possible with a separate script
  `install_prerequisites.py` rather than through `setup.py
  install_prerequisites`.

## [2020.08.18]

### Added
- Respect sensor azimuth and dip when converting RESP to StationXML.
- Scenario-generator (Colosseo) now supports user-specified lists of stations.

### Changed
- FDSN client now checks arguments against service description (WADL) by
  default.
- Improved FDSN client and documentation.

### Fixed
- Fix Py2/Py3 related crashes of `fomosto server`.
- Fix installation dependency issues.
- Fix error in EPS export of GmtPy (GMT5).
- Fix broken CSV export in CrustDB.
- Fix broken help panel in some snufflings.
- Fix buggy marker removal in Snuffler
