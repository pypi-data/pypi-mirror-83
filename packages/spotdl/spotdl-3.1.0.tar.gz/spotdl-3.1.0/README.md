# Announcing spotDL v3.0.2

We have rebuilt spotDL from scratch to be much faster, simpler and better than the old spotDL.
The documentation for the same is a work in progress. v3.0.2 is yet to be released to PyPi so you
can't install it using `pip`, this is intentional. v3.0.2 is still in alpha testing. We request that
you use spotDL v3 and open issues for problems that you come across.

# Installation

1. For v2, run
    ```
    $pip install spotdl
    ```

2. For v3, (latest version)
    ```
    $pip install https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader/archive/master.zip
    ```

3. Voila !

# How to use (instructions for v3)
To download a song run,

    # spotdl $trackUrl
    spotdl https://open.spotify.com/track/08mG3Y1vljYA6bvDt4Wqkj?si=SxezdxmlTx-CaVoucHmrUA

To download an album run,

    # spotdl $albumUrl
    spotdl https://open.spotify.com/album/2YMWspDGtbDgYULXvVQFM6?si=gF5dOQm8QUSo-NdZVsFjAQ

To download a playlist run,

    # spotdl $playlistUrl
    spotdl https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWXhcuQw7KIeM?si=xubKHEBESM27RqGkqoXzgQ

To download an artist's songs run,

    # spotdl $artistUrl
    spotdl https://open.spotify.com/artist/6fOMl44jA4Sp5b9PpYCkzz

To search for and download a song (not very accurate) run,

    # spotdl $songQuery
    spotdl 'The HU - Sugaan Essenna'

To resume a failed/incomplete download run,

-   ```
    # spotdl $pathToTrackingFile
    spotdl 'Sugaan Essenna.spotdlTrackingFile'
    ```

-   Note, '.spotDlTrackingFiles' are automatically created during download start, they are deleted on
    download completion

You can chain up download tasks by seperating them with spaces:

    # spotdl $songQuery1 $albumUrl $songQuery2 ... (order does not matter)
    spotdl 'The Hu - Sugaan Essenna' https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWXhcuQw7KIeM?si=xubKHEBESM27RqGkqoXzgQ ...

Spotdl downloads up to 4 songs in parallel - try to download albums and playlists instead of
tracks for more speed.
