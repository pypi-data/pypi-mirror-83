If you are stuck with a problem using Brian, please do get in touch at our
`community forum <http://brian.discourse.group>`__.

You can save time by following this procedure when reporting a problem:

 1.   Do try to solve the problem on your own first. Read the documentation,
      including using the search feature, index and reference documentation.
 2.   Search the mailing list archives to see if someone else already had the
      same problem.
 3.   Before writing, try to create a minimal example that reproduces the
      problem. You’ll get the fastest response if you can send just a handful
      of lines of code that show what isn’t working.
