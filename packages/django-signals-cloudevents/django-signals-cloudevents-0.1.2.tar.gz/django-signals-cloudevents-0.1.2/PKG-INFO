        Django signals cloudevents
        =====
        
        This apps allow you to produce `Clouevents <https://cloudevents.io/>`_ starting from your models signals sending them to a configurable url (sink).
        
        This app is mainly intended to transform a Django instance into a Knative source, through a SinkBinding or ContainerSource.
        
        For more information visit the `Knative eventing documentation <https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/>`_
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "django_signals_cloudevents" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'django_signals_cloudevents',
            ]
        
        2. Register your models like this::
        
            from django_signals_cloudevents import send_cloudevent
        
            post_save.connect(send_cloudevent, sender=YourModel)
        
        3. [Optional] As said previously, by default this app is configured to be used with a SinkBinding and get sink url from the environment variable K_SINK and the source name from K_SOURCE.
        It is possible to override the chosen env variable in your project settings, here is the default configuration::
        
            CLOUDEVENTS_ENV = {
                "SINK_VAR": "K_SINK",
                "SOURCE_VAR": "K_SOURCE"
            }
