Description: pyramid_csrf_multi_scheme
        =========================

                :alt: Build Status
        
        This package enables two separate cookie tokens on each request, bound to the scheme:
        
        * a SECURE HTTPS only cookie
        * a mixed-use insecure http token (which is also available on https).
        
        If the current scheme is `HTTPS`:
        
        * only the SECURE HTTPS token will be considered
        * HOWEVER calls to generate a new token will reset both the SECURE HTTPS and the
          insecure http tokens.
        
        If the current scheme is `insecure http`:
        
        * the SECURE HTTPS tokens are ignored as they are not even available, and only the
          insecure http token is considered.
        
        
        Python Versions
        ---------------
        
        This package is currently supported under Python2.7 and 3.8; other 3.x versions may work.
        
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        If an application supports both `HTTP` and `HTTPS` endpoints, this package simplifies
        isolating the CSRF data from both.
        
        
        Is this necessary?
        ------------------
        
        I'm not sure, but have decided to err on the side of caution.
        
        HTTP traffic is sent in plaintext and capable of being intercepted by a
        man-in-the-middle or network packet sniffing.
        
        It seems plausible that someone might read a csrf token via HTTP and use that
        in attempts to compromise HTTPS endpoints in a mixed use environment.
        
        A better option is to only use HTTPS tokens and forms - but that is not
        always an option.
        
        
        debugtoolbar support!
        ---------------------
        
        just add to your `ENVIRONMENT.ini` file, or similar application configuration.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            debugtoolbar.includes = pyramid_csrf_multi_scheme.debugtoolbar
        
        Tthe debugtoolbar will now have a `CSRFMultiScheme` panel that has the following info:
        
        * configuration info on the cookie names
        * incoming request csrf values
        * outgoing response csrf values
