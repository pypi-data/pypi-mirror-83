Description: # elektra
        
        The purpose of the `elektra` project is to provide a utility to create and convert power prices to their respective block constructs.
        
        There are two primary methods implemented in the elektra project
        
        * create_prices
        * scrub_hourly_prices
        
        ## Create Prices
        
        The *create_prices* method takes the following parameters:
        
        * `flow_date` - *date* | The as of date for the power prices
        * `ticker` - *string* | The ticker symbol for the power product
        * `node` - *string* | The node on the power grid
        * `iso` - *string* | The short name of the Independent Service Operator
        * `block` - *string* | The power block for the prices
        * `frequency` *string* | The price frequency, either Daily or Monthly
        * `prices` *dataframe* | A Python dataframe of prices consisting of `flow_date`, `hour_ending`, and `price`
        
        The response from the method is a single price *float* the provided attributes.
        
        ## Scrub Hourly Prices
        
        The *scrub_hourly_prices* method takes the following parameters:
        
        * `flow_date` - *date* | The as of date for the power prices
        * `ticker` - *string* | The ticker symbol for the power product
        * `node` - *string* | The node on the power grid
        * `iso` - *string* | The short name of the Independent Service Operator
        * `prices` *dataframe* | A python dataframe of prices consisting of `flow_date`, `hour_ending`, and `price`
        
        The response from the method is a Python dataframe with the following columns of data:
        
        * Hour Beginning
        * Hour Ending
