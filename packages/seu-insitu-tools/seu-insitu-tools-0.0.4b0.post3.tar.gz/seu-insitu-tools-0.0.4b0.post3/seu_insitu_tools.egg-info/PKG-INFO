Description: # insitu-tools
        
        A set of command line tools that find and compare *In situ* expression patterns between mRNA expression images, specifically, the *Drosophila* embryos.
        
        The algorithm used is described in this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/974614.974636).

        Some steps are taken to enhance performance, including:
        
        * Coversion of Color images to grayscale, differentiating stains and embryo texture.
        
        * Linear Transformation of intensity to normalize signals across images.
        
        * 4 orientations' comparison to determine the best score.
        
        * Normalize local GMM scores using the self comparison score.
        
        * Global GMM scores (mutual information scores) are calculated on the union area of the 2 embryos.
