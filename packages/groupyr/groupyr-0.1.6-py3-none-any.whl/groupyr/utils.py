def check_groups(groups, X, allow_overlap=False, fit_intercept=False):
    """Validate group indices.

    Verify that all features in ``X`` are accounted for in groups,
    that all groups refer to features that actually exist in ``XX``,
    and, if ``allow_overlap=False``, that all groups are distinct.

    Parameters
    ----------
    groups : list of numpy.ndarray
        list of arrays of non-overlapping indices for each group. For
        example, if nine features are grouped into equal contiguous groups of
        three, then groups would be ``[array([0, 1, 2]), array([3, 4, 5]),
        array([6, 7, 8])]``. If the feature matrix contains a bias or
        intercept feature, do not include it as a group. If None, all
        features will belong to one group.

    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The training input samples. If ``X`` includes a bias or intercept
        feature, it must be in the last column and ``fit_intercept`` should
        be ``True``.

    allow_overlap : bool, default=False
        If True, allow groups to overlap. i.e. each feature may belong to
        multiple groups

    fit_intercept : bool, default=False
        If True, assume that the last column of the feature matrix
        corresponds to the bias or intercept.

    Returns
    -------
    groups : list of numpy.ndarray
        The validated groups.
