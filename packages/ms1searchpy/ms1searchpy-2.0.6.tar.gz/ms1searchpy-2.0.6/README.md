ms1searchpy - a DirectMS1 proteomics search engine for LC-MS1 spectra
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The .tsv (or mzML) and .fasta files are required for basic operation of the script.
tsv file is tab-separated text file with peptide features generated by Dinosaur software (J.Teleman et al., "Dinosaur: A Refined Open-Source Peptide MS Feature Detector", JPR 2016) or Biosaur (https://github.com/abdrakhimov1/Biosaur) from mzML file. This file can be generated by any other software for peak-picking and must contain columns 'massCalib', 'rtApex', 'charge' and 'nIsotopes' columns.
For a —Åonvenient usage, mzML files can be used directly and the script will run an attached version of Dinosaur (installed Java is required).  
For an efficient usage of retention time, user can install and use ELUDE prediction algorithm (-elude path_to_elude_binary should be used in parameters).
For the most efficient usage of retention time, user can install and use DeepLC prediction algorithm (-deeplc path_to_deeplc_binary should be used in parameters).

Algorithm can be run with following command:

    ms1searchpy path_to_MZML -d path_to_fasta

    OR

    ms1searchpy path_to_peptideFeatures -d path_to_fasta

The script output contains files: all identified proteins (filename_proteins_full.csv), filtered proteins (filename_proteins.csv), all matched peptide match fingerprints (filename_PFMs.csv), all matched peptide match fingerprints with features prepared for Machnine Learning (filename_PFMs_ML.csv) and log file with estimated mass and RT accuracies (filename_log.txt).
