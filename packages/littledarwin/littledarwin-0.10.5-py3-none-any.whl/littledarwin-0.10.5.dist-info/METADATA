## How to Use:
On your selected python platform use:

    pip3 install littledarwin

You can use the program by executing it as a module:

For a maven project, all you need to do is to pass the required arguments to LittleDarwin:

    python3 -m littledarwin -m -b \
			    -p [path to production code (usually in src/main)] \
			    -t [path to build directory (usually the one containing pom.xml)] \
			    --timeout=[in seconds, the duration of a normal test execution] \
			    -c [build command separated by commas (usually mvn,clean,test)]
