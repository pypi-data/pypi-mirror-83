        ## Hexafid
        
        Hexafid is an experimental block cipher. [DANGER!](#caveat-emptor) 
        
        The project goals are to produce a cipher that:
        - works easily with pen and paper
        - secures confidentiality of information
        - offers plausible deniability if discovered
        - exhibits greater strength in software
        
        ### Caveat Emptor
        
        - Hexafid began as a hobby project during the COVID-19 pandemic
        - The work has NOT yet been peer reviewed by the academic community
        - The algorithms have NOT yet been proven to have strong security
        - The software is released under an open source licence (MIT) that:
            - Limits ANY liability, and 
            - Provides NO warranty

        ### Installation  
        <!--- [![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/hexafid)](https://pypi.org/project/hexafid/) --->
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install hexafid.
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install hexafid
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        As an end user:
        ```console
        $ hexafid --version
        $ hexafid --help
        $ hexafid
        ```
        
        As a developer:
        ```python
        from hexafid import hexafid_core as hexafid
        hexafid.encrypt(message, key, mode, iv, period, rounds)  # returns ciphertext string
        hexafid.decrypt(message ,key, mode, period, rounds)  # returns plaintext string
        ```
        NOTE: use of these libraries assumes that you understand the cryptographic implications of changing parameters.
