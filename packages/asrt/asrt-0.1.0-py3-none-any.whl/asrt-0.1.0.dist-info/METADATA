ASRT is a high-level deep learning API for speech recognition,
written in Python and capable of running on top of
Keras, TensorFlow, or MxNet.
Use ASRT if you need a deep learning library that:
- Allows for easy and fast prototyping for speech recognition
  (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
- Supports both Keras and other Deep learning framework(on future).
- Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
- Contains a api server module for developers to test models easily.

ASRT is compatible with Python 3.0-3.7
and is distributed under the GPL v3.0 license.
