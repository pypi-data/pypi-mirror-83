Description: # Yale Client
        Yale client is a python client for interacting with the Yale APIs.
        
        This project is largely taken from https://github.com/domwillcode/yale-smart-alarm-client
        
        The API has been split into alarm and lock, and the auth parts has been moved
        away into a separate class to keep things noise free.
        
        The codebase has also been updated be more python3 ish, dropping the ancient string formats etc.
        
        
        Supported functions:
        - alarm api:
            - Arm full (away)
            - Arm partial (away/night)
            - Disarm
            - Get alarm status
        - lock api
            - get status
            - lock
            - unlock
        
        ### Python version
        Tested with the following python versions
        * Python 3.7
        * Python 3.6
        
        ### Usage
        Create a client with:
        ```
        from yaleclient import YaleClient
        client = YaleClient(username="", password="")
        ```
        where username and password are your Yale credentials.
        
        #### Locks
        Iterate the connected locks
        ```pyhon
        for lock in client.lock_api.locks():
            print(lock)
        ```
        
        lock a single lock
        ```pyhon
        lock = client.lock_api.get(name="myfrontdoor"):
        lock.close()
        ```
        
        unlock:
        ```pyhon
        lock = client.lock_api.get(name="myfrontdoor"):
        lock.open(pin_code="1234566")
        ```
        
        
        #### Alarm
        Change the alarm state with:
        ```
        client.alarm_api.arm_full()
        client.alarm_api.arm_partial()
        client.alarm_api.disarm()
        ```
        or 
        ```
        client.alarm.set_alarm_state(<mode>)
        ```
        where 'mode' is one of:
        ```
        from yaleclient.alarm import (YALE_STATE_ARM_PARTIAL,
                                      YALE_STATE_DISARM,
                                      YALE_STATE_ARM_FULL)
        ```
        
        Is the alarm armed fully or partially:
        ```
        client.alarm_api.is_armed() # == True
        ```
        
        or return alarm status. eg.
        ```
        client.alarm_api.get_armed_status() is YALE_STATE_ARM_FULL
        ```
