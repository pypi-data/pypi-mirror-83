"""
Data-structures for the representation of quantitative models.

Automata and automata networks are mutable. This is an intentional design
choice. The validity of the model is partly assured during construction,
for instance, a location can only be added if the invariant is a boolean
expression in the scope of the automaton. As usual, if an algorithm works
on a model, e.g., analyzing it, the model must not be modified.
