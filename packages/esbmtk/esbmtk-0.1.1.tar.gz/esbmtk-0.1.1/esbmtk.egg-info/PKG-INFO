        # ESBMTK - An Earth-sciences box modeling toolkit
        
        ESBMTK is python library which aims to simplify typical box modeling
        projects the in Earth-Sciences. I started this project to teach myself
        python and explore object oriented programming.  The code became
        however functional enough that the focus of this project has shifted
        to make box modeling more approachable for classroom teaching. So
        performance and scalability are not great. Specifically, the solved is
        a simple forward Euler scheme, so stiff problems are not handled
        gracefully.
        
        At present, it will calculate masses/concentrations in reservoirs and
        fluxes including isotope ratios. It provides a variety of classes
        which allow the creation and manipulation of input signals, and the
        generation of graphical results. There is however no support for
        chemical reactions (including equilibrium reactions).

        # News
        
        -   Oct. 27<sup>th</sup>, added documentation on how to integrate user written
            process classes, added a class which allows for concentration
            dependent flux. Updated the documentation, added examples
        -   Oct. 25<sup>th</sup>, Initial release on github.

        # Contributing
        
        Don't be shy. Contributing is as easy as finding bugs by using the
        code, or maybe you want to add a new process code? If you have plenty
        of time to spare, ESMBTK could use a solver for stiff problems, or a
        graphical interface ;-)

        # Installation
        
        ESBMTK relies on the following python versions and libraries
        
        -   python > 3.5
        -   matplotlib
        -   numpy
        -   pandas
        -   logging
        -   nptyping
        -   numbers
        
        please install the above with pip or conda etc. 
        
        At present, there is no ready made installation routine. Rather
        download the `esbmtk.py` library into your local working library using
        one of the following commands
        
        -   <https://github.com/uliw/esbmtk/archive/main.zip>
        -   <https://github.com/uliw/esbmtk.git>
        -   git@github.com:uliw/esbmtk.git

        # Documentation
        
        See the documentation folder, [specifically the quickstart guide](https://github.com/uliw/esbmtk/blob/main/Documentation/ESBMTK-Quick-Start_Guide.org).
        
        At present, I also provide the following example cases (as py-files
        and in jupyter notebook format)
        
        -   A trivial carbon cycle model which shows how to set up the model,
            and read an external [csv file to force the model](https://github.com/uliw/esbmtk/blob/main/Examples/A%20simple%20carbon%20cycle%20example/C_cycle.org)
        -   The same model as be before but now to demonstrate how to add
            pyramid shaped signal, and how to use the rate constant process to
            adjust concentration dependent flux rates[concentration dependent flux rates](https://github.com/uliw/esbmtk/blob/main/Examples/Using%20a%20rate%20constant/rate_example.org).
        
        Last but not least, I added a short [guide how to add your own process
        classes to the ESBMTK](https://github.com/uliw/esbmtk/blob/main/Documentation/Adding_your_own_Processes.org)
