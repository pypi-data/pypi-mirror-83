## Release 0.1.3

## Overview
protfasta - a robust parser for protein-based FASTA files.

## Documentation

For all documentation see [https://protfasta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://protfasta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For code see [https://github.com/holehouse-lab/protfasta](https://github.com/holehouse-lab/protfasta).


## Installation

`protfasta` has been tested on Linux and macOS. It should also work on Windows but we haven't tested it there yet. 

`protfasta` can be downloaded and installed directly from PyPI using **pip**:

    pip install protfasta

If this has worked, the `pfasta` command-line tool should be available from the command-line

    pfasta --help

And you're done. This also means you can now ``import`` and use **protfasta** in your Python workflow. 

## Simple example

	import protfasta

	# sequences is now a dictionary where keys are FASTA headers and values are sequences.
    sequences = protfasta.read_fasta('inputfile.fasta')


## Errors and help
For bug reports or errors please raise an issue on this github repository (see the [Issues](https://github.com/holehouse-lab/protfasta/issues) tab at the top).
