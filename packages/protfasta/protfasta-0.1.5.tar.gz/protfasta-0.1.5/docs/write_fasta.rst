write_fasta
=================
``write_fasta`` allows for standardized FASTA files to be written to disk using a dictionary or a list of two-position lists. Note that it is possible to automatically write a FASTA file when reading in using the ``output_filename`` keyword in the function ``read_fasta``.

Unlike ``read_fasta``, ``write_fasta`` has a relatively limited set of options, which are documented below.

For usage examples see the :ref:`example_label` page.
