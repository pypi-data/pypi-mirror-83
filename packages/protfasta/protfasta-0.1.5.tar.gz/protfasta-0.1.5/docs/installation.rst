**protfasta** has been tested on Linux and macOS. It should also work on Windows but we haven't tested it there yet. 

**protfasta** can be downloaded and installed directly from PyPI using **pip**:

.. code-block:: none

   pip install protfasta


If this has worked, the **pfasta** tool should be available from the command-line

.. code-block:: none
   
   pfasta --help


And you're done. This also means you can now ``import`` and use **protfasta** in your Python workflow.
