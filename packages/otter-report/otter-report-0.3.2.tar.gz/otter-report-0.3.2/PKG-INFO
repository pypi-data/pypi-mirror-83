        Otter
        ===============================
        
        
        Otter is a simple HTML report generator for Python jobs. Otter was
        designed to produce reports on long-running jobs on remote machines,
        and send them to a web server, but it's able to process many different
        outputs from Python scripts, and convert them into neat and readible HTML pages.
        
        Otter makes use of Twitter Bootstrap to make an easily themed layout for its output.

        Quick Example
        -------------
        
        Otter can be used to produce reports containing a mixture of prose, data, and figures with minimal code. 
        
        .. image:: images/screenshot.jpg
        
        This report was generated with just a small number of lines of Python: ::
        
        	   import otter
        	   import otter.bootstrap as bt
        
        	   report = otter.Otter("index.html", author="Daniel Williams", title="Test Page", author_email= "daniel.williams@ligo.org")
        
        
        	   with report:
        	       report + "#Section Title"
        
        	       report + "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
        
        
        	   with report:
        
        	       row = bt.Row(3)
        
        	       import numpy as np
        	       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        
        	   with report:
        	       f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1)
        	       x = np.linspace(0,10, 100)
        	       ax.plot(x, np.sin(x))
        
        	       row[1] + f
        
        	       row[0] + {"mass": "1kg", "price": "$1000", "area": 400}
        
        	       report + row
        
        	   with report:
        	       report + "##Subsection Header"
        	       report + "Fusce vel lectus ultricies,... "
