.SH NAME
ups-config.json \- defines UPS identification and communication parameters

.SH SYNOPSIS
.ul
\fB[REPOSITORY Directory]\fR/ups-config.json
.br
/usr/share/rickslab-ups-utils/config/ups-config.json

~/share/rickslab-ups-utils/config/ups-config.json

.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.ul
ups-config.json
contains the definitions of parameters critical to the functioning of \fBups-utils\fR. A
template for the creation of this file is provided in the distribution package as
.ul
ups-config.json.template
and should be used as a base for creating a usable
\fBups-config.json\fR
file.  The file is in standard JSON format, with an entry for each UPS intended to be
used with \fBusp-utils\fR. Each entry begins with a text key as a unique UPS identifier.
In the sample below, these identifiers are "1", "2", and "3".  Each identifier is
followed by a dictionary of key/value pairs that define identification/communication
parameters for each UPS.  The \fB"ups_IP"\fR value is the IP address or FQDN of the
UPS.  The \fB"display_name"\fR value is the name of the UPS as expected to be displayed
by \fBups-utils\fR.  The \fB"ups_type"\fR value indicates the UPS/NMC combination of the
given UPS.  Currently, only "apc-ap9630" and "eaton-pw" are supported.  Other values will
be treated as incompatible. The \fB"daemon"\fR value should be true if it is the UPS that
supplies power to the machine running the utility.  The \fB"snmp_community"\fR is the
shared secret used in the snmp v2 protocol.
