Reproducible figures and tables from paper
==========================================

The notebooks below can be used to reproduce the figures and tables contained in the manuscript and supplement. 

**Note**: These pages are automatically regenerated on each commit. Over time, accumulated changes to the codebase may cause the minor differences to emerge between the published figures and what is contained in these notebooks. To access the exact version of the code that was used to generate the published figures, use the git commit tag `paper <https://github.com/terhorst/xsmc/tree/paper>`_.
