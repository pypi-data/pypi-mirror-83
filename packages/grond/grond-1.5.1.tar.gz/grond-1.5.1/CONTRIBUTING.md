# Grond development environment and contribution guide

## Language

Grond is written in the Python programming language (versions ==2.7 and >=3.4).

## Deployment

Grond uses Setuptools for its installation script. See `setup.py` and
`setup.cfg` in the project root directory.

## Testing

Nosetests is used for testing. To run all tests, run

```sh
python -m nose test
```

## CI

Drone CI tests are run on any commits pushed to the repository. By default,
flake8 is run, tests are run and test coverage is measured and docs are built.
Success is reported to the Pyrocko Hive. Pushing to specific branches triggers
extra pipelines:

* pip: pip sdist is built, tested and uploaded to PyPi-testing
* deploy-docs: docs are published
* candidate: same as pip
* release: same as pip but without pip testing  and upload to PyPi-live +
  deploy-docs

## Versioning and releases

Git is used for version control. Use development branches for new features.
Master branch should always point to a stable version.

The Grond project  adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

Notable changes must be documented in the file `CHANGELOG.md`. The format of
the change log is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

### Commit message conventions

* start with lower case
* colon-prepend affected component
* try to use imperative form
* examples:
  - `docs: add section about weighting`
  - `waveform targets: correct typo in component names`
  - `waveform targets: fix issues with misaligned traces`

### Branching policy

* Use topic branches to develop new features.
* Open a pull request and use the Gitea-tags `Want Review`, `Need Revision`, to
  signal its state.
* When a topic is complete, all tests pass and it is rebased to current master:
  merge with `--ff-only` and don't forget to update the changelog.
* The `master` branch should always point to a stable version.
* Extra CI pipelines are run on branches named `release`, `candidate`,
  `pip-wheels`, `deploy-docs`, and `hptime`. See also release protocol.

### Rebase small changes before pushing

Try to rebase little changes on top of master (or any other development branch)
before pushing, it makes the history much better readable. Here is a safe way
to do so.

*If we have already commited and merged changes to local master:*

```sh
git checkout master
git fetch origin    # important, otherwise we rebase to outdated
git rebase origin/master
git push origin master
```

with `git config --global pull.rebase true` this can be shortcutted to

```sh
git pull
```

*Or after we have commited to a feature branch:*

```sh
git checkout feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
git checkout master
git merge origin/master --ff-only
git merge feature --ff-only
git push origin master
```

If during push it refuses to upload ('not fast forward...') then repeat the
procedure, because someone else has pushed between your fetch and push.

**Tip:** use `rebase -i ...` to simplify/fixup/beautify your changeset.

## Code style

Grond source code must follow the PEP8 coding standards. It must pass the
code style check provided by the `flake8` tool.

Additionally,

* use i/n convention for indices and counts
  - e.g. `for istation in range(nstations):`
* do not abbreviate words unless this would result in ridiculously long names
* use British english, e.g.
  - 'modelling' rather than 'modeling'
  - 'analyser' rather than 'analyzer'
  - 'optimiser' rather than 'optimizer'
* log and exception messages:
  - capital beginning
  - final period
  - Progress actions should end with `...`, e.g. `Generating report's archive...`
  - e.g. `raise ProblemDataNotAvailable('No problem data available (%s).' % dirname)`
  - in-text names must be quoted; not needed after colons
* docstrings:
  - Docs are built with Sphinx, use rst syntax.
  - Follow the usual convention 1 line summary, blank line, description.

## Documentation

Grond's documentation is built using the `Sphinx` tool. See the `docs`
in the project root directory. Build with `make html` in `docs`.

*Text style rules:*

* titles: only capitalize first word
* use British english
