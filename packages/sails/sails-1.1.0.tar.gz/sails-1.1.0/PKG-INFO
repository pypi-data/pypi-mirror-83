Description: Spectral Analysis In Linear Systems
        ===================================
        
        This repository contains the Spectral Analysis In Linear Systems tools
        for python (sails)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        If you just want to install sails to use it, the easiest way is to get it from pip
        using ```pip install sails```.
        
        If you are reading this file, you probably have a source distribution of sails and
        may be interested in working on the software.  In that case, as there is no
        compiled code, you can simply set your ```PYTHONPATH``` to include this directory.
        Alternatively, you can use ```python3 setup.py build``` or run ```make``` or
        ```make doc``` to install the software into the normal ```build/``` directory
        and/or build the documentation using sphinx.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Documentation for the current release can be found at https://sails.readthedocs.org
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        See the requirements.txt file.
        
        Some of these aren't strict dependencies, but are instead what we develop
        against (i.e. we don't guarantee not to use features which only exist from that
        release onwards).
        
        Repository
        ==========
        
        The main git repository can be found at https://vcs.ynic.york.ac.uk/analysis/sails
        
        Contributing
        ============
        
        If you wish to raise issues on, or contribute patches to SAILS, you will need
        an account on the Gitlab server.  This can be obtained by going to
        https://vcs.ynic.york.ac.uk, going to the "Sign In" link and then using
        the self-service interface to create an account.  By default you will be able
        to file issues on the codebase.  If you wish to be able to create MRs please
        tag @aq501 or @mark in the relevant issue and we will give you permission to
        do so.  Alternatively, please feel free to email one of us.
