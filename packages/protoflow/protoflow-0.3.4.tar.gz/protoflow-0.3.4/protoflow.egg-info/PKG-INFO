        ## Description
        
        This is a Python toolbox brewed at the Mittweida University of Applied Sciences
        in Germany for bleeding-edge research in Prototype-based Machine Learning
        methods and other interpretable models. The focus of ProtoFlow is ease-of-use,
        extensibility and speed.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ProtoFlow can be easily installed using `pip`. To install the latest version, run
        ```
        pip install -U protoflow
        ```
        To also install the extras, run
        ```bash
        pip install -U protoflow[docs,others,tests]
        ```
        To install the bleeding-edge features and improvements before they are release on PyPI, run
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/si-cim/protoflow.git
        git checkout dev
        cd protoflow
        pip install -e .[docs,others,tests]
        ```
        
        For gpu support, run
        ```bash
        pip install -U protoflow[gpu]
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        The documentation is available at <https://www.protoflow.ml/en/latest/>. Should
        that link not work try <https://protoflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### For researchers
        ProtoFlow is modular. It is very easy to use the modular pieces provided by
        ProtoFlow, like the layers, losses, callbacks and metrics to build your own
        prototype-based(instance-based) models. These pieces blend-in seamlessly with
        Keras allowing you to mix and match the modules from ProtoFlow with other Keras
        modules.
        
        ### For engineers
        ProtoFlow comes prepackaged with many popular Learning Vector Quantization
        (LVQ)-like algorithms in a convenient API. If you would simply like to be able
        to use those algorithms to train large ML models on a GPU, ProtoFlow lets you do
        this without requiring a black-belt in high-performance Tensor computation.
