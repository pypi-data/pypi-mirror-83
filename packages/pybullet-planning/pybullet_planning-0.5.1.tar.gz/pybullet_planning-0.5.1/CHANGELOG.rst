0.5.0

0.1.0
----------

**Added**

* diagnosis collision checking function to help visualizing the collision bodies' information
* add `workspace_bodies` to the `get_collision_fn` to check collisions with the obstacles specified in a URDF file.
* move `ik_interface` module from application side to this repo, since it's "universal" for fixed-end robot. Might need to add a separete one for robots with moving base later.
* enable travis ci unit test, collision_fn well tested
* `get_floating_body_collision_fn` to check a body without joints's collision. Associated test added.
* Added `snap_sols` to `kinematics.ik_utils`

**Changed**

* add `extra_disabled_collisions` parameter to `get_collision_fn`, `plan_joint_motion`
* Changed `get_name` to return name without index if name is not `''`

**Removed**

* `get_collision_diagnosis_fn` removed, integrated into the `get_collision_fn`

**Fixed**

* `utils.numeric_sample.randomize`: `random.shuffle` cannot operate on a `range` in py 3.x. Enforced conversion to `list` to fix it.
* Fixed `get_collision_fn` to ignore checking between bodies both specified in attachment and obstacles (prioritize its role as attachment)

**Deprecated**

**TODO**

* add body name for bodies from `create_obj`

**Requested features**

* `clone_body` work for bodies from `create_obj`
