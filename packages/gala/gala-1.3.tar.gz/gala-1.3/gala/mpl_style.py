""" This module contains dictionaries that can be used to set a
matplotlib plotting style.
It is mostly here to allow a consistent plotting style in tutorials,
but can be used to prepare any matplotlib figure.

Using a matplotlib version > 1.4 you can do::

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
    >>> from gala.mpl_style import mpl_style
    >>> pl.style.use(mpl_style) # doctest: +SKIP

for older versions of matplotlib the following works::

    >>> import matplotlib as mpl
    >>> from gala.mpl_style import mpl_style
    >>> mpl.rcParams.update(mpl_style) # doctest: +SKIP
