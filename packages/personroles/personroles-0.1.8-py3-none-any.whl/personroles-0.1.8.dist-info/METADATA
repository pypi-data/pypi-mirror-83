A set of dataclasses concerning roles (academic, politician, ...)  of persons and their particulars

Features
--------

Currently names of this structure are supported::

    Names:                       first_name middle_name_1 middle_name_2 last_name/s
    Names with academic title:   academic_title/s first_name ... last_name/s
    Names with peer title:       peer_title/s first_name ... last_name/s
    Names with peer preposition: first_name ... peer_preposition last_name/s
    Names with all titles:       academic/peer_title first_name ... peer_preposition last_name/s

These roles have been sketched::

    Academic - academic_title
    Person - gender, born, age, deceased
    Noble - peer_title, peer_preposition
    Politician - minister, offices, party, parties
    MoP - legislature, state, electoral_ward, ward_no, voter_count, parl_pres, parl_vicePres

Usage
-----
::

    from personroles import person

    tom = person.Academic("Thomas H.", "Smith", academic_title="MBA")
    print(tom)

    Academic:
    academic_title=MBA
    first_name=Thomas
    last_name=Smith
    middle_name_1=H.

::

    from personroles import mop_role

    bob = mop_role.MoP("14", "NRW", "SPD", "Bob R.", "Smith", academic_title="Dr.", electoral_ward="Köln I")
    print(bob)

    MoP:
    academic_title=Dr.
    electoral_ward=Köln I
    first_name=Bob
    gender=male
    last_name=Smith
    legislature=14
    membership={'14'}
    middle_name_1=R.
    parties=[Party(party_name='SPD', party_entry='unknown', party_exit='unknown')]
    party_name=SPD
    state=NRW
    voter_count=121721
    ward_no=13

Credits
-------

This package was started with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.
Also the `project setup`_ by Martin Heinz was very helpful.
I felt the changes were necessary to keep the files containing the roles small.

Installation
------------
::

    pip install personroles

or 

::

    pipenv install personroles

Contribute
----------

| **Please fork first and use for your own ends.**
| This package is structured like this:

::

    personroles
    ├── mop_role.py
    ├── person.py
    ├── politician_role.py
    ├── your-contribution_role.py
    ├── resources
    │   ├── constants.py
    │   └── helpers.py
    └── tests
        ├── test_mop.py
        ├── test_person.py
        ├── test_politician.py
        └── test_your-contribution.py

Because of its modular structure, all you need to do is add another role as
"your-contribution_role.py", and another test as "test_your-contribution.py".
Use current \*_role modules as blueprint and delete if not needed.

Support
-------

Fork and improve.

Planned
-------

Fork and repeat with different roles.
