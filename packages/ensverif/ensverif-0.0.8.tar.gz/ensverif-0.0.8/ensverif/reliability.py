# This function computes what is needed to plot (modified) reliability diagrams.
# Note that this function does *not* adopt the definition of Murphy and Winkler (1977), 
# which would require the transformation of the ensemble into a binary forecast using 
# a threshold.
# Instead, we verify whether each confidence interval (i.e. 10%,..., 90%) corresponds
# to its definition: for instance the 10% confidence interval should include 10% of 
# observations.
#
# This function *does not* plot the diagram. To plot the diagram, one has to type 
# "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt" and then "plt.plot(nominal_coverage, effective_coverage)"
#
# Finally, as an additional information, we also compute the mean length of each 
# confidence interval. A variant of the reliability diagram could be:
# "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt" and then "plt.plot(length, effective_coverage)", 
#as in Boucher et al. (2010)
