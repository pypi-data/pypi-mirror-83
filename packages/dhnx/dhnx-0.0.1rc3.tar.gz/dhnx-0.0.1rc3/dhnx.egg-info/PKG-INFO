        About
        =====
        
        The aim of DHNx is to provide a toolbox for building models of
        district heating/cooling systems. 
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        If you have a working Python3 environment, use pypi to install the latest DHNx version:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install dhnx
        
        Install the developer version of DHNx by cloning DHNx to your computer and running
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install -e DHNx
        
        in your virtualenv.
        
        Check out the
        `examples <https://github.com/oemof-heat/DHNx/tree/dev/examples>`_ to get started.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        The documentation (work in progress) can be found here
        `<https://dhnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
        To build the docs locally using sphinx-build run the following in a terminal.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sphinx-build docs <build-dir>
