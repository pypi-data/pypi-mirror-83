        =======================
        visaplan.plone.infohubs
        =======================
        
        This product establishes a "mini language" for the calculation and re-use of
        information from Plone_ instances during the processing of a single request,
        e.g. when creating breadcrumbs; e.g., if the login state is important for the
        breadcrumb for ``/foo``, that same state might be important for the
        ``/foo/bar`` breadcrumb as well.
        
        It is part of the footing of the "Unitracc family" of Plone sites
        which are maintained by `visaplan GmbH`_, Bochum, Germany; the mini-language
        was established during the development of the now factored-out package
        ``visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs``.
        
        The purpose of this package (for now) is *not* to provide new functionality
        but to factor out existing functionality from our former monolithic Zope product.
        Thus, it is more likely to lose functionality during further development
        (as parts of it will be forked out into their own packages,
        or some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better
        alternatives in standard Plone components).
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - The ``info`` dictionary holds the collected information of interest
          during processing of the request.
        - The ``hub`` dictionary holds the tools which were used to get those
          information chunks.
        
          - For now, some of those tools are quite proprietary adapters or browsers,
            usually now factored out to the ``visaplan.plone.adapters`` and
            ``visaplan.plone.browsers`` packages, respectively.
        
            This is not ideal, and it will change; we'd rather depend directly on
            standard Plone tools and/or the ``plone.api`` instead.
