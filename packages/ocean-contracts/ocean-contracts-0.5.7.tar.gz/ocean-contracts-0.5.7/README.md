## Get Started

For quick installation of the contract `ABIs`:

```bash
npm i @oceanprotocol/contracts
```

### Usage
For more details about how to use ocean contracts, please refer to the quick start section in [ocean-lib-js](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-lib-js#-quick-start) and [ocean-lib-py](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-lib-py#quickstart).

### Local development

For local development of the `contracts` setup the development environment on your machine as follows:

As a pre-requisite, you need:

- Node.js v12+
- npm

Clone the project and install all dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/ocean-contracts.git
cd ocean-contracts/

# install packages
npm i

# to compile contracts
npm run compile
```

## Testing

Run tests with 

```bash
# for unit tests
npm run test:unit

# for test coverage
npm run test:cover
```

## Code Linting

Linting is setup for `JavaScript` with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) & Solidity with [Ethlint](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Ethlint).

```bash
# to check lint issues
npm run lint
```

Code style is enforced through the CI test process, builds will fail if there're any linting errors.

## Networks

### Testnets

For local development, start a local testnet using `ganache-cli`, then run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Or depoly ocean-contracts on `rinkeby` network as follows:
```
export MNEMONIC='YOUR MNEMONIC SHOULD BE HERE'
# If you are using remote test or main net using Infura
export INFURA_TOKEN='GET INFURA_TOKEN FROM INFURA PLATFORM' 
npm run deploy:rinkeby
```
After the deployment, check out the [address.json](artifacts/address.json) file containing the deployed contracts addresses.

Checkout the supported deployment(s) on these [networks](docs/README.md#deployments).

## Documentation

To use generate documentation via `solidity-docgen` please run:

```bash
npm run doc:generate
```
