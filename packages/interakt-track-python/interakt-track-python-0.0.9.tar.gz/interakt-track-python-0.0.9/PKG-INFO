Description: # Interakt Track Python
        
        # Getting Started
        
        Install `interakt-track-python` using pip
        
            pip install interakt-track-python
            
        Inside your app, you’ll want to **set your** `write_key` before making any track calls:
        
            import track
            
            track.write_key =  "YOUR_WRITE_KEY"
        
        
        ## Development Settings
        
        The default initialization settings are production-ready and queue messages to be processed by a background thread.
        
        In development you might want to enable some settings to make it easier to spot problems. Enabling `track.debug` will log debugging info to the Python logger. You can also add an `on_error` handler to specifically print out the response you’re seeing from our API.
        ```
        def on_error(error, data):
            print("An error occurred:", error)
        
        
        track.debug = True
        track.on_error = on_error
        
        ```
        
        # Identify
        The `identify` lets you tie a user to their actions and record traits about them. It includes a unique **User ID** or **Phone Number and Country Code** any optional traits you know about them.
        
        Either of the two for user identification is required:
        
         - **user_id**
         - **phone_number** with **country_code**
        
        Example `identify` call:
        ```
        track.identify(
        	user_id="<USER_ID>",
        	traits={
        		"name": "John Doe",
        		"email": "john@email.com",
        		"age": 24
        	}
        )
        ```
        
        # Event
        `event` lets you record the actions your users perform. Every action triggers what we call an “event”, which can also have associated properties.
        
        Example `event` call:
        ```
        track.event(
        	user_id="<USER_ID>",
        	event="Add to Cart",
        	traits={"amount": 200}
        )
        ```
