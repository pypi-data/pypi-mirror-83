Description: # Pyriod
        
        Python implementation of basic period detection and fitting routines for astronomical time series.
        
        To install, use
        
        ```pip install Pyriod```
        
        or download the latest (possibly unstable) version from GitHub and run
        
        ```python setup.py install```
        
        Additional documentation is available at [pyriod.readthedocs.io](https://pyriod.readthedocs.io).
        
        This code uses [Qgrid](https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid) and other Jupyter widgets to interactively display the frequency solution.  
        
        To display the Pyriod GUI, you will need to first enable the following Jupyter notebook extensions in the terminal:
        ```
        jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix qgrid
        jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension
        jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipympl
        ```
        Pyriod does not work in JupyterLab.
        
        This is a serious work in progress with many planned improvements.  Please be patient, but also feel free to request new features by raising GitHub issues.
