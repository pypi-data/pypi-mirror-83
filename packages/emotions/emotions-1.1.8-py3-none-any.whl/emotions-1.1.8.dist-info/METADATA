> - ```import emotions as aE```: For Importing the module as ```aE```.
> - ```aE.emotion(ask, url)```:  Here ```ask=``` The word you want the **AI** to react to, and `url=` the url of your Firebase Database(This will be used as the storage). Note that the **Mood** of AI is independent.
> - ```aE.learn(input, emotion, url)```:  It is used to teach the **AI** about different **words** and our **feeling** about them. Here input refers to the **words**, emotion refers to the  **feeling** and `url` reffers to the *url* of the **Firebase Database**.  Once the **information** is stored it prints `'Got it!'`.Note that if your firebase database has no bucket `'/count'` it will **not work**. So first go ahead and create a `'/count'`  and store value `0` with tag `/1`
