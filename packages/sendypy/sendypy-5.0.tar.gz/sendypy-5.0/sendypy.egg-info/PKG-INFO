        ------------------
        
        Simple module to interface with the Sendy API (https://sendy.co/api)
        
        **Version:** 5.0

        Dependencies
        ============
        
        -  It was written for Python 3.6+
        -  Depends on the requests module
        
        **NOTE:**
        
        -  **Version 4.0.5** we're changing the version to match the version of
           Sendy that this is most recently updated for. When Sendy introduces
           changes that require a lib update, we will update the version to
           match the Sendy version.
        -  **Version 0.2** now requires ``api_key`` varaible for all API calls.
           This is a required change to the functionality of Sendy as of version
           4.0.4. This is a potentially breaking code change. Please update your
           code to always provide the API key before upgrading to sendypy v0.2.
        -  **Version 0.1.3b** adds the new "title" variable to the
           ``create_campaign`` API call. It effects the default ordering of
           variables in the call. If you're upgrading from a previous version
           please ensure that you account for the new ordering of variables.
           This new variable was added in Sendy v2.1.2.6
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        PIP:
        
        ::
        
            pip install sendypy
        
        Basic Manual Install:
        
        ::
        
            $ python setup.py build
            $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        Alternative Install (Manually):
        
        Place sendy directory in your Python path. Either in your Python
        installs site-packages directory or set your $PYTHONPATH environment
        variable to include a directory where the impersonate directory lives.
        
        Use
        ===
        
        All the variables and response values are described in the `Sendy API
        docs <https://sendy.co/api>`__
        
        Usage is simple :
        
        ::
        
            from sendy.api import SendyAPI
            api = SendyAPI(
                 host='https://your-sendy-install.com/sendy/',
                 api_key='YOUR_API_KEY',
            )
        
        You can also provide the optional ``debug`` variable (defaults to
        False). This will print debug into to stdout when sending a request to
        your Sendy install.
        
        **Subscribe** :
        
        ::
        
            api.subscribe(
                'list_id_here',
                'email@address.com',
                'optional first name',
                optional_field=value,
                ...
            )
        
        *Optional fields*
        
        -  ``country``: User's 2 letter country code.
        -  ``ipaddress``: User's IP address.
        -  ``referrer``: The URL where the user signed up from.
        -  ``gdpr``: If you're signing up EU users in a GDPR compliant manner.
        -  ``hp``: Include this 'honeypot' field to prevent spambots.
        -  ``silent``: If ``true`` then Sendy will treat subscription as single
           opt-in regardless of list settings (defaults to ``false``)
        
        **Unsubscribe** :
        
        ::
        
            api.unsubscribe('list_id_here', 'email@address.com')
        
        **Delete** :

            api.delete('list_id_here', 'email@address.com')
        
        **Subscription Status** :
