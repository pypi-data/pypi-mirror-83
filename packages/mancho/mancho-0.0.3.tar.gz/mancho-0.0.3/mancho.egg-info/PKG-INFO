Description: # Mancho: A musical transcription assistant.
        
        This is a tool to make musical transcriptions.
        Documentation is WIP.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Mancho depends on [rubberband](https://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/), portaudio and PyGtk3. Make sure these dependencies are installed.
        
        On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS you can run:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install python3-pip python3-pyaudio python3-gi rubberband-cli
        ```
        
        Afterwards:
        ```bash
        python3 -m pip install mancho
        ```
        
        ## Quickstart
        Start mancho by running:
        ```bash
        python3 -m mancho
        ```
        
        1. Load an audio file using the open dialog.
        2. You can scroll and zoom using the arrow keys.
        3. You can select a region to loop using the mouse.
        4. Set the playback using the slider and click play (or press `spacebar`)
        5. By pressing `a`, you can set markers. They can be removed using `backspace` and `del`
        6. `s` selects the region between the markers.
        7. `shift` and arrow keys extend the selection, `alt` and arrow keys shorten it. `ctrl` and arrow keys move the selection.
