- neurodata_type_def: LabeledEvents
  neurodata_type_inc: Events
  doc: A list of timestamps, stored in seconds, of an event that can have different
    labels. For example, this type could represent the times that reward was given,
    as well as which of three different types of reward was given. In this case, the
    'data' dataset would contain values {0, 1, 2}, its 'labels' attribute would contain
    three text elements, where the first (index 0) specifies the name of the reward
    associated with data = 0, the second (index 1) specifies the name of the reward
    associated with data = 1, etc. The labels do not have to start at 0 and do not
    need to be continuous, e.g. the 'data' dataset could contain values {0, 10, 100},
    and the 'labels' attribute could contain 101 values, where labels[0] is 'No reward',
    labels[10] is '10% reward', labels[100] is 'Full reward', and all other entries
    in 'labels' are the empty string.

      doc: Mapping from an unsigned integer (the zero-based index) to a string, used
        to understand the values in the 'data' dataset. Use an empty string to represent
        a label value that is not mapped to any text.
- neurodata_type_def: TTLs
  neurodata_type_inc: LabeledEvents
  doc: Data type to hold timestamps of TTL pulses. The 'data' dataset contains the
    integer pulse values (or channel IDs), and the 'labels' dataset contains user-defined
    labels associated with each pulse value (or channel ID). The value at index i
    of the 'labels' dataset corresponds to a pulse value (or channel ID) of i in the
    'data' dataset. For example, the first value (index 0) of the 'labels' dataset
    corresponds to a pulse value of 0. See the LabeledEvents type for more details.
- neurodata_type_def: AnnotatedEventsTable
  neurodata_type_inc: DynamicTable
  doc: Table to hold event timestamps and event metadata relevant to data preprocessing
    and analysis. Each row corresponds to a different event type. Use the 'event_times'
    dataset to store timestamps for each event type. Add user-defined columns to add
    metadata for each event type or event time.
