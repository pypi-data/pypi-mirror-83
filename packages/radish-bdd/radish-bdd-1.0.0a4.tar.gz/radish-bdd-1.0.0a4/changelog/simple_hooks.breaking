The simple Hooks using either ``@before`` or ``@after`` require to be called as a function.

The following Hook definition:

.. code-block:: python

    @before.each_scenario
    def setup(scenario):
        pass

must be changed to:

.. code-block:: python

    @before.each_scenario()
    def setup(scenario):
        pass
