# FLask Restplus Data

![Upload Python Package](https://github.com/nucklehead/flask-restplus-data/workflows/Upload%20Python%20Package/badge.svg)

Flask Restplus data aims to provide a consistent programming model for data access. It makes uses of some ORM libraries to abract the calls and allow the underlying data store to maintain any special fonctionalities.

This is heavily inspired by Spring Data.

Currently this supports SQL databses and MongoDB. But only SQL was tested for now.
