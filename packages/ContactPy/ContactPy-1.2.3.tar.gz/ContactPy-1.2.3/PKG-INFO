Description: ##### Bascically i guess it is a Python Library for contacts like gmail vcard and and stuff.
        
        ##### Like when bass go boom boom.
        
        ##### U, not me. import the module named vcard by just importinig it easy as it sounds like this example
        
        ```from contacts import vcard```
        to create a card you simply write:
        ```python
        from contacts import vcard
        
        card = vcard.VCard(path)
        card.create(display_name:list, full_name:str, number:str, email:str=None)
        ```
        to read a card you simply write:
        ```python
        from contacts import vcard
        
        card = vcard.VCard(path)
        card.read(att:str)
        ```
        The (attributes or att) are
        ```python
        {"name":"The display name", "full_name":"The full name", "number":"the number", "email":" the email"}
        ```
        or you can do the dot value
        ```python
        from contacts import vcard
        
        card = vcard.VCard(path)
        theName = card.name
        theNumber = card.number
        theFullName = card.fullName
        theEmail = card.email
        ```
        
        ##### Gmail thing
        
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail(email, password)
        ```
        You can register stuff, no worries everything is pickled
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail(email, password)
        mail.register('name')
        ```
        and then u can load the the email and password with the load command
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail()
        mail.load('name')
        ```
        u can get all the registerd members by doing
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail()
        mail.memberList()
        ```
        add messages by doing
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail()
        mail.load('name')
        mail.setMessage(subject, to)
        ```
        content by doing
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail()
        mail.setContent(content)
        ```
        attachment by
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail()
        mail.load('name')
        mail.addAttachment(path:list, types:list)
        ```
        path is obviously the path. in types you can only put images or pdf in uppercase or lowercase like this example
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail()
        mail.addAttachment(["test.jpg", "test.pdf"], ["image", "PDF"])
        ```
        add html i think you know this already but you are only allowed to use inline styles or in html css
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail()
        mail.load('name')
        mail.addHTML(path)
        ```
        login this is obvious 
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail()
        mail.load('name')
        mail.login()
        ```
        send message just send it
        ```python
        from contacts import gmail
        
        mail = gmail.Gmail()
        mail.load('name')
        mail.login()
        mail.sendMessage()
        ```
