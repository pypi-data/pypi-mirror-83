Description: # Agentpy - Agent-based modeling in Python
        
        Agentpy is a package for the development and analysis of agent-based models in Python. The project is still in an early stage of development. If you need help or want to contribute, feel free to write me via joel.foramitti@uab.cat.
        
        **Main features:**
        
        - Design of agent-based models with complex procedures.
        - Creation of custom agent types, environments, and networks.
        - Container classes for operations on groups of agents and environments.
        - Experiments with repeated iterations, large parameter samples, and distinct scenarios.
        - Output data that can be saved, loaded, and transformed for further analysis.
        - Tools for sensitivity analysis, interactive output, animations, and plots.
