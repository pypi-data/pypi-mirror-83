        NEWS for lazr.sshserver
        =======================
        
        0.1.11 (2020-10-27)
        ===================
        
        - Officially add support for Python 3.8.
        - Fix lazr.sshserver.auth.PublicKeyFromLaunchpadChecker on Python 3: Twisted
          passes the username in the credentials object as bytes.
        
        0.1.10 (2019-10-30)
        ===================
        
        - Stop using deprecated twisted.conch.checkers.SSHPublicKeyDatabase.
        
        0.1.9 (2019-04-30)
        ==================
        
        - Add Python 3 support.
        
        0.1.8 (2018-07-02)
        ==================
        
        - Add support-in-principle for authenticating using ECDSA or Ed25519 keys;
          this also requires a sufficient version of Twisted (which at the time of
          writing supports ECDSA but not Ed25519) and support in the Launchpad
          authserver.
        
        0.1.7 (2018-02-26)
        ==================
        
        - Fix regression in 0.1.5: restore support for unsigned queries for whether
          publickey authentication would be acceptable.
        - Stop using deprecated PyCrypto-based attributes of
          twisted.conch.ssh.keys.Key.
        
        0.1.6 (2018-02-26)
        ==================
        
        - Handle the case where Twisted fails to load the user-supplied public key.
        
        0.1.5 (2017-12-21)
        ==================
        
        - Work around a bug in paramiko < 2.0.0: if the most significant byte of an
          RSA signature is zero, then it strips leading zero bytes rather than
          zero-padding it to the correct length.  This previously caused sporadic
          failures when running with Twisted >= 16.0.0, since cryptography is
          pickier about this than PyCrypto was.
        
        0.1.4 (2015-11-29)
        ==================
        
        - Require gmpy for better twisted.conch performance.
        
        0.1.3 (2015-11-18)
        ==================
        
        - Fix starting a lazr.sshserver.service.Factory with moduli_path=None.
        
        0.1.2 (2015-11-18)
        ==================
        
        - Add moduli file handling to lazr.sshserver.service, needed to support the
          diffie-hellman-group-exchange-* key exchange algorithms.
        
        0.1.1 (2015-01-21)
        ==================
        
        - Drop install-time dependency on bzr, although it is still required to run
          the test suite.
        
        0.1 (2015-01-13)
        ================
        
        - Initial release
