stopwatch-timer is a module that provides a Stopwatch class. This class can be used to time operations. It has 'start' and 'stop' methods that can be used to pause the time. It doesn't use anything like threading.Thread or multiprocessing.Process, instead; it uses math to calculate how much time has passed. By default, the stopwatch uses time.perf_counter to get the current time, but this can be changed to whatever you like in the __init__ function. Stopwatches also have a 'laps' attribute, which stores all times when laps were created. Laps can be added using the 'add_lap' function. Finally, stopwatches also have 'reset', 'reset_laps', and 'restart' functions, which reset and stop the stopwatch, reset the laps on the stopwatch, and reset and start the stopwatch respectively.
