Update after renaming the repository and the package.

### Changes

  markers (see [#38](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering/issues/38))

## [Version 0.7.0](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-ordering2/0.7.0/)

including some PRs (manually merged).

### Added
- added support for markers like run(before=...), run(after=),
  run("first") etc.
  (imported from [PR #37](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering/pull/37))

  ``--failed-first`` implementation to override the ordering.
