pytest-order [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pytest-order.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pytest-order)
================
This is a fork of [pytest-ordering](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering).
That project is not maintained anymore, and there are several helpful PRs
waiting for merge. Therefore I decided to create this fork that tries to
combine the original code with most of the provided PRs.   
My hope is that the original project will be moved to the pytest
organization as outlined in 
[this issue](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering/issues/32). When this
happens, this fork will be obsolete. 


pytest-order is a pytest plugin to run your tests in a specific order.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrbean-bremen/pytest-order.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrbean-bremen/pytest-order)

Have you ever wanted to easily run one of your tests before any others run?
Or run some tests last? Or run this one test before that other test? Or
make sure that this group of tests runs after this other group of tests?

Now you can.

Install with:

    pip install pytest-order

This defines some pytest markers that you can use in your code.

For example, this:

    import pytest

    @pytest.mark.run(order=2)
    def test_foo():
        assert True

    @pytest.mark.run(order=1)
    def test_bar():
        assert True

Yields this output:

    $ py.test test_foo.py -vv
