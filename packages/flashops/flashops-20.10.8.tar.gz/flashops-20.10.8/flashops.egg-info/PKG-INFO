Description: 
        # What's FlashOps
        
        FlashOps (a clipped compound of "flash" and "operations") is a tool that simplifies the process of managing a Linux server through SSH. A set of operations or commands that you often perform can be simplified to just one or two characters.
        
        Maybe you think a shell script is good way to do your work. But FlashOps can do more, like sync file between remote and your computer.
        
        # How to use
        
        FlashOps uses Fabric to manage remote Linux servers via SSH. Before using FlashOps, make sure you can connect and manage your Linux server via SSH.
