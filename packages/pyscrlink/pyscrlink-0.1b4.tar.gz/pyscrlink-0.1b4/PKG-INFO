Description: # pyscrlink
        
        Pyscrlink is [Scratch-link](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-link) for Linux.
        Scratch-link is a software module which connects
        [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and Bluetooth devices such as
        [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/). However, as of October 2020, it works only
        on Windows and MacOS, and cannot connect Scratch and micro:bit on Linux
        operating systems.
        
        Pyscrlink allows Linux OSes to connect Scratch and bluetooth devices. It uses
        Linux Bluetooth protocol stack [Bluez](http://www.bluez.org/) and its python
        interfaces [pybluez](https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez) to handle Bluetooth,
        and [bluepy](https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy) to handle Bluetooth Low
        Energy, or BLE, connections. It is confirmed that pyscrlink connects Scratch
        3.0 and a micro:bit, Lego Mindstorms EV3, Lego WeDo and Lego Boost.
        
        Pyscrlink requires python version 3.6 and later to use websockets. If your
        system has python older than version 3.6, install newer version. If your Linux
        system has explicit command names python3 and pip3 for python version 3,
        use them in the instructions below.
        
        Pyscrlink started in 2019 as "bluepy-scratch-link", which was a small work only
        for micro:bit and bluepy for BLE connections. After many contributions, it
        expanded coverage to other devices and pybluez for Bluetooth connections. The
        name "bluepy-scratch-link" was misleading that it indicate that it would depend
        only on bluepy. As of October 2020, the project was renamed from
        "bluepy-scratch-link" to "pyscrlink" to avoid the confusion.

        Installation
        ------------
        1. Prepare Bluetooth/BLE controller.
        
           Confirm that your Linux PC has a Bluetooth controller with BLE support.
           Bluetooth 4.0 controller supports BLE. If your PC does not have it, need
           to plug USB Bluetooth 4.0 adapter.
        
           Note: BLED112 USB dongle with Bluegiga BGAPI is not supported.
        
        2. Install required packages.
        
            ```sh
            Ubuntu
            $ sudo apt install bluez libbluetooth-dev libnss3-tools libcap2-bin
            Arch
            $ sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils nss libcap
            ```
        
        3. Install python modules.
        
            ```sh
            $ pip install pyscrlink
            Or if your system has python3 command,
            $ pip3 install pyscrlink
            ```
        
        4. For Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, set bluepy-helper capability.
        
            ```
            $ bluepy_helper_cap
            Set capacbility 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin' to /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/bluepy-1.3.0-py3.8.egg/bluepy/bluepy-helper
            ```
        
            The command above requires super user privilege. It may request to input
            super user password.
        
        5. For micro:bit, install Scratch-link hex on your device.
        
            * Download and unzip the [micro:bit Scratch Hex file](https://downloads.scratch.mit.edu/microbit/scratch-microbit-1.1.0.hex.zip).
            * Flash the micro:bit over USB with the Scratch .Hex File, you will see the
              five character name of the micro:bit scroll across the screen such as
              'zo9ev'.
        
        Usage
        -----
        1. For Lego Mindstorms EV3, pair your Linux PC to the EV3 brick.
        
           First, turn on the EV3 and ensure Bluetooth is enabled.
        
           Then, pair using your Linux desktop's the Bluetooth settings.
        
           If using Gnome:
              * Settings -> Bluetooth
              * Click on the EV3 device name
              * Accept the connection on EV3 brick
              * Enter a matching PIN on EV3 brick and Linux PC. '1234' is the value Scratch suggests.
              * Confirm EV3 status is "Disconnected" in Bluetooth settings
        
           With a Raspberry Pi default Raspbian desktop, click the Bluetooth logo in the top right of the screen and
           Add Device. Then follow the Gnome instructions. You will be warned that the Raspberry Pi
           does not know how to talk to this device; that is not a problem.
        
           Alternatively you can perform pairing from the command-line:
           ```shell script
           $ bluetoothctl
        
           [bluetooth]# power on
           Changing power on succeeded
        
           [bluetooth]# pairable on
           Changing pairable on succeeded
        
           [bluetooth]# agent KeyboardOnly
           Agent registered
        
           [bluetooth]# devices
           ...
           Device 00:16:53:53:D3:19 EV3
           ...
        
           [bluetooth]# pair 00:16:53:53:D3:19
           Attempting to pair with 00:16:53:53:D3:19
        
           # Confirm pairing on the EV3 display, set PIN to 1234
        
           Request PIN code
           [agent] Enter PIN code: 1234
           [CHG] Device 00:16:53:53:D3:19 Connected: yes
           [CHG] Device 00:16:53:53:D3:19 Paired: yes
           Pairing successful
        
           [bluetooth]# quit
           ```
        
        2. Start scratch-link python script.
            ```sh
            $ scratch_link
            ```
        
        3. Connect scratch to micro:bit or Lego Mindstorms:
            * Open FireFox or Chrome and access [Scratch 3.0](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
            * Select the "Add Extension" button
            * Select the extension for your device (e.g., micro:bit or Lego Mindstorms EV3 extension) and follow the prompts to connect
            * Build your project with the extension blocks
        
        In Case You Fail to Connect
        ---------------------------
        
        1. If Scratch says "Make sure you have Scratch Link installed" but you are sure
           that scratch-link python script is running, check that Firefox or Chrome
           allows local server certificate.
            * Open Firefox or Chrome and access [https://device-manager.scratch.mit.edu:20110/](https://device-manager.scratch.mit.edu:20110/). You will see a security risk warning.
            * In **Firefox**: Click "Advanced" and click "Accept Risk and Continue".
            * In **Chrome**: type the special bypass keyword `thisisunsafe`.
            * Immediately, you will see "Failed to open a WebSocket connection". This is expected.
        
        2. If device scan fails, check systemd bluetooth service status.
            ```
            systemctl status bluetooth.service
            ```
            * If the service is not working, refer guide of your distro to set it up.
            * If the service is working, also check that /etc/bluetooth/main.conf sets AutoEnable=true.
        
        3. If scratch_link.py says "failed to connect to BT device: [Errno 13] Permission denied",
           make sure to pair the bluetooth device to your PC before connecting to Scratch.
