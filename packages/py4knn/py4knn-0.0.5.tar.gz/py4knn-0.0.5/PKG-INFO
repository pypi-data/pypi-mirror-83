Description: # py4knn
        
        K-Nearest Neighbors Python Library
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        This project is simply an implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm in python programming language.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        This Project Has No Prerequisites
        
        
        ### Installing
        
        The easiest way to install py4knn is by using pip
        
        ```
        pip install py4knn
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        There is only 1 public method of knn class. It is predict method, it takes 5 argument namely ```x_train```, ```t_train```, ```x_test```, ```k```, and ```distance``` calculation method. We provide 6 distances namely euclidean, squared_euclidean, manhattan, canberra, chebyshev, and bray_curtis.
        ```
        from py4knn.k_nearest_neighbors import knn
        classifier = knn()
        x_train = [[0.23,0.54],[0.45,1.23],[1.54,0.23],[0.93,0.535]]
        t_train = [0,1,0,1]
        x_test = [[0.34,0.65],[0.90,0.50]]
        y = classifier.predict(x_train,t_train,x_test,1,'euclidean')
        ```
