Description: W3G: The Warcraft 3 Replay File Format
        --------------------------------------
        This is a single module package that contains everything that is needed to 
        read in the Warcraft 3 replay file format ``*.w3g``.  W3G is a custom 
        binary format.  The benefits of this are that the files are small, even for 
        very long games.  The downside is that for them to be meaningfully a lot of 
        extra data needs to be provided (as is done here for you) for these files
        to be meaningfully deciphered.
        
        The replays basically amount to a bunch of metadata (map, players, etc) and a 
        big event list.  The file parser here provides you with access to this data 
        as well as some post-processed metrics, such as actions-per-minute (APM).  
        
        The API should be easy to use and figure out. Classes and attributes are named in a
        sane way. Here is an example of usage::
        
            import w3g
            f = w3g.File('replay.w3g')
        
            winner = f.winner()
            print(winner)
        
            f.print_apm()
        
        You can also use this file in script mode to print out the entire game and 
        its stats::
        
            $ ./w3g.py  replay.w3g
