Description: # Octopy-Energy
        
        Python client for the Octopus energy API
        
        <br>
        
        ### Installing Octopy-Energy
        
        The first step to getting running with the library is to install it through pip.
        
        
        ```python
        ! pip install octopyenergy
        ```
            Requirement already satisfied: octopyenergy in c:\users\user\path\to\octopy-energy (0.0.1)
            
        <br>
        
        Once installed `octopyenergy` can be imported into your scripts.
        
        
        ```python
        import octopyenergy as oe
        from octopyenergy.api import DownloadManager
        ```
        
        <br>
        
        ### User Inputs
        
        We now need to assign values for our account/meter details.
        
        N.b. we recommend that you store your account details in a `.env` file and then use the `dotenv` library to set them as environment variables, which can in turn be picked up by `os` and assigned to local variables.
        
        
        ```python
        octopus_api_key = 'your_octopus_api_key'
        meter_mpan = 'your_meter_mpan'
        meter_serial = 'your_meter_serial'
        ```
        
        <br>
        
        ### Configuring the Download Manager
        
        We'll start by initialising the `DownloadManager`, when we do so we can pass a number of parameters which will configure defaults in the download manager. The `octopus_api_key` is also required for some requests.
        
        
        ```python
        download_manager = DownloadManager(meter_mpan=meter_mpan, 
                                           meter_serial=meter_serial, 
                                           api_key=octopus_api_key)
        
        download_manager
        ```
