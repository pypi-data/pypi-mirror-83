# setuptools-declarative-requirements

This projects adds the ability for projects using setuptools declarative configuration
to specify requirements using requirements files.

> ⚠ **There's a reason why this isn't, at least yet, supported by default. Please [read why](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1951).**

Anyway, if you know what you're doing, then this library solves the missing feature of defining requirements using requirements files.

## Setup
Your ``pyproject.toml`` should look like:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=42", "wheel", "setuptools_declarative_requirements"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[requirements]
install_requires = "requirements/base.txt"
tests_requires = "requirements/tests.txt"
[requirements.extras_require]
docs = "requirements/docs.txt"
web = "requirements/web.txt"
```

> ⚠ This project makes no attempt to validate your requirements files.
> **The only thing it does is include every non empty line from your requirements files which doesn't start with `#`, `-r` and `--`.**
