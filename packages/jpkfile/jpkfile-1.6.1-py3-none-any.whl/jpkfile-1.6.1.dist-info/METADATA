jpkfile
=======

jpkfile is a module for reading of data archives recorded with
`JPK Instruments <http://www.jpk.com/>`_.
The project's repository can be found
`here <https://gitlab.gwdg.de/ikuhlem/jpkfile>`_.

Install
=======

You have the following three options to install jpkfile.

via pip
-------

The simplest way, if you have internet access on the target device, is to install  via `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_. In a command line type:

.. code::

   $ pip install --user jpkfile

via source
----------

You can also clone/download the source files from `jpkfile's project page <https://gitlab.gwdg.de/ikuhlem/jpkfile>`_. Navigate to your copy of the project folder in a command line and type:

.. code::

   $ python setup.py install --user

add module to your :code:`PYTHONPATH`
-------------------------------------

Currently :code:`jpkfile` has only one relevant python file :code:`jpkfile.py`, which makes "installing" straight-forward: you simply need to add the folder in which the .py file lies to your python path.  
One way to do so is to add a *.pth* file containing the path to the folder as text to your user's *site-packages* folder:
* On my Ubuntu 18.04 machine, the site-packages folder is at `/home/<username>/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages`
* If yours isn't there, you can figure it out by starting python in the command line and typing

>>> import site
>>> site.USER_SITE

* Open a new file in a text editor, enter the path to the folder containing the jpkfile module.
* Save the file into the site-packages folder.

That's it. You should now be able to import jpkfile anywhere on your system.

First Steps
===========

You can have a look at the :code:`read_data_from_jpk_archive.py` file, or, if you have jupyter/ipython notebook installed, at the :code:`read_data_from_jpk_archive.ipynb` file in the examples folder. Those examples show you first steps how to use the jpkfile module.

Documentation
=============

The module is documented using sphinx. You can find a built version at `readthedocs.io <http://jpkfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_, and also download it as PDF or HTML from there.   
Alternatively, you can build it yourself locally. The source files include a :code:`docs` folder, which contains all the contents for the documentation. It requires sphinx (I tested only version 2.0.1) and the sphinx_rtd_theme to build.
