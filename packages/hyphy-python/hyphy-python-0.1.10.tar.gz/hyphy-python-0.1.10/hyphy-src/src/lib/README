README

This directory contains my first stab at SWIG-wrapped HyPhy libraries for 
Python and R. 

This has been tested on a Mac OS X.5 with Python 2.5.1 and R 2.6.2, but it 
should work with slightly older versions and on Linux as well. Both Python 
and R are expected to be in the PATH variable

Prior to running these scripts, please execute the buildFromSVN.sh script 
(inside the Scripts directory), then cd to ../../HYPHY/Library directory (relative
to the Scripts directory).

Python:
-------

To build, type 

$python setup.py install

To test, cd to Examples/Python and run

$python BasicHyPhy.py

Look at the comments inside BasicHyPhy.py for simple library usage
example. Also take a look at Examples/HBL/HKY85.bf for how to define
an object retrieval function.


R:
--

To build, type 

$sh build.sh LIBRARY R

The resulting shared library will be placed inside LibraryModules/R/

To test, type (from the root of the HyPhy library directory)

$R

Once inside R, execute

source ('Examples/R/BasicHyPhy.R')

Look at the comments inside BasicHyPhy.R for simple library usage
example. Also take a look at Examples/HBL/HKY85.bf for how to define
an object retrieval function.
