You are now using the Command line interface of Tiny 3D engine,
a Python3 Tkinter lightweight 3D engine, created at CERFACS (https://cerfacs.fr).

This package is mean to be used as a dependency of other packages,
to provide a light 3D feedback for small 3D scenes <100 000 polygons.
This CLI is given here for developers perusal and demonstrations.
Find the script of these small tools in the /examples folder of the package.

This is a python package currently installed in your python environement.
See the full documentation at : https://tiny-3d-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

DISCLAIMER: Tiny 3D engine is a brute force flat renderer.
As it is NOT using your graphical card, 
do not excpect anything fancier than a 1980 video game.
