reportlab-qrcode
================

reportlab-qrcode implements a QR code flowable for the ReportLab PDF library
using the [qrcode package](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/).


Installation
------------

reportlab-qrcode can be installed via pip:

    pip install reportlab-qrcode


Usage
-----

Simply use the *QRCodeImage* class with your data. All non-recognized keyword
arguments will be passed to the *qrcode.QRCode* class from the qrcode package.

    from reportlab.pdfgen.canvas import Canvas
    from reportlab_qrcode import QRCodeImage

    doc = Canvas('simple.pdf')
    qr = QRCodeImage('Some data here')
    qr.drawOn(doc, 0, 0)
    doc.showPage()
    doc.save()

For further examples, including setting fill and back colors, QR code size,
error correction level, as well as using the QR code as ReportLab Flowable
object, see the *examples* directory.


Maintenance note
----------------

This package is considered completed. So please do not wonder if you see no
further commits. Despite the lack of new commits, this package is still
maintained, i. e., I plan to keep this package compatible with the newest
Python, qrcode and ReportLab version. If you find a bug, please open an issue
in the issue tracker.
