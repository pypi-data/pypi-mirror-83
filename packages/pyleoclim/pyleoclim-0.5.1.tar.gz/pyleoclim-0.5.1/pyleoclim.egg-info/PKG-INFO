        # Pyleoclim
        
        **Python Package for the Analysis of Paleoclimate Data**
        
        Pyleoclim is a Python package primarily geared towards the analysis and visualization of paleoclimate data. Such data often come in the form of timeseries with missing values and age uncertainties, so the package includes several low-level methods to deal with these issues, as well as high-level methods that re-use those within scientific workflows.
        
        High-level modules assume that data are stored in the Linked Paleo Data ([LiPD](http://www.clim-past.net/12/1093/2016/)) format and makes extensive use of the [LiPD utilities](http://nickmckay.github.io/LiPD-utilities/). Low-level modules are primarily based on [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) arrays or [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) dataframes, so Pyleoclim contains a lot of timeseries analysis code (e.g. spectral analysis, singular spectrum analysis, wavelet analysis, correlation analysis) that can apply to these more common types as well. See the example folder for details.
        
        The package is aware of age ensembles stored via LiPD and uses them for time-uncertain analyses very much like [GeoChronR](http://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/).
        
        New in version 0.5.0:
        
        - code design centered on timeseries objects
        - [user interface](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/blob/master/example_notebooks/pyleoclim_ui_tutorial.ipynb) allowing succinct, expressive calls
        - expanded repertoire of spectral and wavelet methods
        - inclusion of singular spectral analysis, permitting missing data
        - Sphinx [documentation](http://linkedearth.github.io/Pyleoclim_util/) for all functions
        - clean, additive [plot styles](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/blob/master/example_notebooks/plot_styles.ipynb) inspired by Matplotlib [style sheets](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/gallery/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html).  
        
        
        ### Documentation
        
        Online documentation is available through readthedocs:
        - [Stable version](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (available through Pypi
        - [Latest version](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (from the development branch)
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        pyleoclim supports Python 3.8
        
        ### Installation
        
        The latest stable release is available through Pypi. We recommend using Anaconda or Miniconda with a dedicated environment.
         
         `pip install pyleoclim`
        
        You may also want to use the Development version from GitHub to access the latest functionalities
