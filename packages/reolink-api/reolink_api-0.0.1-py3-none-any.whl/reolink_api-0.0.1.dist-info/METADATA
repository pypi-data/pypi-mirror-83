## ReolinkCameraAPI

### Purpose

This repository's purpose is to deliver a complete API for the Reolink Camera's, ( TESTED on RLC-411WS )


### But Reolink gives an API in their documentation

Not really. They only deliver a really basic API to retrieve Image data and Video data.

### How?

You can get the Restful API calls by looking through the HTTP Requests made the camera web console. I use Google Chrome developer mode (ctr + shift + i) -> Network.

### Get started

Implement a "Camera" object by passing it an IP address, Username and Password. By instantiating the object, it will try retrieve a login token from the Reolink Camera. This token is necessary to interact with the Camera using other commands.

### Styling and Standards

This project intends to stick with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
