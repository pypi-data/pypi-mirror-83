Description: # CWT-Seismology
        This code is optimized to compute the Characteristics Functions using the complex/real 
        Morlet Wavelet, see references. It can also be used to detect signals in the waveform. 
        
        Currently, the algorithm is also implemented in the 
        [Integrated Seismic Programs](https://github.com/rcabdia/ISP/tree/Pyqt5_migration)
        (ISP)
