Description: Atmospheric phase screen generator using a "woofer-tweeter" algorithm
        ======================================================================
        
        This Python 3 module implements the algorithm described in the paper “Simulating Large Atmospheric Phase Screens Using a Woofer-Tweeter Algorithm.” Optics Express 24, no. 20 (October 3, 2016): 23566–71. https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.24.023566.
        
        
        To see a customisable movie of the phase screens generated by this module, you can run an app over the web using Streamlit Share by following the link below:
        
        https://share.streamlit.io/dbuscher/megascreen/tests/demos/streamlit_movie.py
        
        Alternatively, view a short movie in a Jupyter notebook at

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        The module runs under Python3 and requires ``numpy`` and ``scipy``.
        
        For running some of the example code, the ``astropy`` library is used. 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        On unix-like systems do
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install MegaScreen
        
        or if that does not work because of file permission errors, then
        ::
        
            sudo pip3 install MegaScreen
        
         
        Alternatively download and unpack a copy of this repository, change the working directory to this directory and then use
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install -e .
        
        
        This should install the package into the Python path.
        
        Usage
        -----
        See the documentation at http://megascreen.readthedocs.io/ for a description on how to use the module.

        1.0.1
        -----
        - Updated demos so they don't crash with recent assert
        - Demos can run without installing MegaScreen
        - Streamlit demo app can run on Streamlit Share
        
        1.0.0
        -----
        - Added an assert to check that the size of a window does not exceed the size of a tweeter screen
        - Removed restriction on dx and increased memory efficiency by allocating the minimum number of tiles needed
        
        0.5.0:
        ------
        - Added a numIter parameter to MegaScreen() to allow straightforward use in for loops
        - All parameters to MegaScreen() now have default values to ease adoption
        - Tidied up test code
        - Added extensive documentation on http://megascreen.readthedocs.io
