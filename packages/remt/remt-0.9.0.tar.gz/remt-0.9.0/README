Installation
============
Create configuration file `~/.config/remt.ini` with contents::

    [connection]
    host=10.11.99.1
    user=root
    password=<your reMarkable tablet password if not using ssh key>

Install `remt` project with `pip`, i.e.:

    $ pip install remt

Usage

summary of the commands can be obtained with `--help` option, i.e.::

    $ remt --help
    usage: remt [-h] {ls,mkdir,export,import,index} ...

    remt 0.7.1 - reMarkable tablet command-line tools

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    subcommands:
      {ls,mkdir,export,import,index}
        ls                  list files on the tablet
        mkdir               create a directory on the tablet
        export              export a notebook or an annotated PDF file from
                            the tablet
        import              import a number of PDF files onto the tablet
        index               create index of PDF file annotations

Annotations
===========
`remt` recognizes highlighter annotations when creating index of PDF file
annotations.

Some rules

- use horizontal lines with highlighter
- overlapping horizontal lines are merged
- non-horizontal lines are ignored
- highlighter is a thick tool and rendering of highlighter depends on
  rotation of the pencil; ignore the rendering when annotating and

  - start annotation before first character
  - end annotation after last character
