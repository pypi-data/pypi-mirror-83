================
openeo_processes
================


openeo_processes is a Python representation of the openEO processes.

The list supported here tries to be as complete as possible, but some processes (typically the 'cube' ones) are intrinsically connected to the back-end implementation and data model, and therefore are omitted here. Examples of missing processes are 'load_collection' or 'merge_cubes'.

Processes are currently aligned with openEO API version 1.0.

Installation
============

1. At the moment, this package is only installable from source.
   So start with cloning the repository::

        git clone https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes-python.git
        cd openeo-processes-python

2. It is recommended to install this package in a virtual environment,
   e.g. by using ``venv`` (from the Python standard library), ``virtualenv``,
   a conda environment, ...
   For example, to create a *new* virtual environment using ``venv``
   (in a folder called ``.venv``) and to activate it::

        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate

   (You might want to use a different bootstrap python executable
   instead of ``python3`` in this example.)

3. Install the package in the virtual environment using one of the following ways,
   as you prefer:

   - traditional way: ``python setup.py install``
   - with pip: ``pip install .``
   - if you plan to do development on the package itself,
     install it in "development" mode with
     ``python setup.py develop`` or ``pip install -e .``

   (Note that in this step we are using python and pip from the virtual environment.)

4. Optionally run the tests::

        python setup.py test
