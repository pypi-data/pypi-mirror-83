Description: PlenoptiCam is an open-source software (macOS, Win or Linux) for scientific light field computation with cross-platform compatibility, few dependencies and a lean graphical user interface.
        Raw exposures from a plenoptic camera require four-dimensional image alignment in order to be decoded as a light field. Provided software addresses this by its ability to calibrate an image taken by a plenoptic camera and extract sub-aperture images or synthetically focused photographs.
        This application is meant for researchers, developers, beginners and other fiddlers who like to experiment with light field technology. Its scope comprises custom-types of plenoptic cameras and is thus not limited to Lytro's image data.
