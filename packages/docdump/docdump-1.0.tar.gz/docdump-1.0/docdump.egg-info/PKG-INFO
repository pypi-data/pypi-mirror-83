        ### A package to extract text from common document types
        
        DocDump aims to allow for raw text data and document metadata to be easily extracted from a 
        range of commonly used document types, such as Word, PDF, PowerPoint, Excel, txt. 
        
        DocDump extracts all text as a single string, and does not preserve text structure. This makes
        it a useful tool in a natural language processing or search pipeline.
        
        DocDump does not perform any preprocessing or normalisation.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from docdump import doc_reader
        
        document = doc_reader("sampleFile.docx")
        
        text_dump = document.text
        metadata = document.metadata
        filetype = document.filetype
        absolute_path = document.path
        ```
         
        ## Installation:
        
        Use pip to install the package and its dependancies.
        
        ```bash
        pip install docdump
        ```
