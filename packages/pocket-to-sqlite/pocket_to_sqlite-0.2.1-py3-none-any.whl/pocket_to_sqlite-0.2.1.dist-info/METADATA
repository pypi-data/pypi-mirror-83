Create a SQLite database containing data from your [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) account.

## How to install

    $ pip install pocket-to-sqlite

## Usage

You will need to first obtain a valid OAuth token for your Pocket account. You can do this by running the `auth` command and following the prompts:

    $ pocket-to-sqlite auth
    Visit this page and sign in with your Pocket account:

    https://getpocket.com/auth/author...

    Once you have signed in there, hit <enter> to continue
    Authentication tokens written to auth.json

Now you can fetch all of your items from Pocket like this:

    $ pocket-to-sqlite fetch pocket.db

The first time you run this command it will fetch all of your items, and display a progress bar while it does it.

On subsequent runs it will only fetch new items.

You can force it to fetch everything from the beginning again using `--all`. Use `--silent` to disable the progress bar.

## Using with Datasette

The SQLite database produced by this tool is designed to be browsed using [Datasette](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/). Use the [datasette-render-timestamps](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-timestamps) plugin to improve the display of the timestamp values.
