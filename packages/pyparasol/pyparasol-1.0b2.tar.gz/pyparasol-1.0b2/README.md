# Parasol
Parasol is a JavaScript library for visualization of multi-objective optimization problems 
such as hyper-parameter tuning and is based on parallel coordinates.

Parallel coordinates make it easy to visualize different parameter configurations

For an interactive example, check out the original authors site for the javascript library:
