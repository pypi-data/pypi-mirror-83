Description: # At the moment this Script is nowhere near being complete, use at your own risk!
        
        # Shelly
        Stuff based around the beautifull small electronic devices from Allterco
        
        ### [Auto-Restrict-Login](Scripts/secure.py)
        This Script queries trough a given number of ips and restricts the http login with a given username and password
        
        ##### Installation
        To install the Script(s) run:
        ```
        pip install shelly-restrict-login-page==0.0.4
        ```
        
        ##### Usage
        To use the script run:
        1. The Script requires the ips as fourth parameter, each seperated by a comma eg ip1,ip2,...
        2. When a login page is already restricted you will be prompted to provide the old password
        3. The Script **doesnt** work with mdns names, just ip addresses
        4. The Script will automatically generate a file called Shelly.json in the same directory as the script, to store the last username and the hash of the last password.
        ```
        python3 secure.py [mode] [username] [password] [ip1,ip2]
          mode  enable/disable
        ```
        ##### Error-Codes
          - 0: Failed to load Shelly.json, check the directory and path. (The script cant find the [Credentials-File](https://github.com/Floplosion05/Shelly/blob/main/README.md#credentials-file))
          - 1: Wrong password entered. (The provided password doesnt match with the saved hash)
          - 2: Right hash found but wrong password provided. (The entered password matches the saved hash, but not the actual password on the login page)
          - 3: Found Shelly.json, but didnt find entry for this device. (The script found the [Credentials-File](https://github.com/Floplosion05/Shelly/blob/main/README.md#credentials-file), but the restricted login was never enabled with this script)
        
        ##### Credentials-File
        The Credentials-File (Shellys.json) is generated and then located in the same directory as the script.
        The structure is:
        ```
        {"devices": [{"ip": "192.168.xxx.xxx", "username": "test", "password": "$pbkdf2-sha256$30000$yZnzPqc0Rqi1NibEeM.5Fw$QZ0sk1Z6K4LMt3UM3AGrrKLk9jBOjwrXsY1psfAPY4Q"}, {"ip": "192.168.xxx.xxx", "username": "test", "password": "$pbkdf2-sha256$30000$yZnzPqc0Rqi1NibEeM.5Fw$QZ0sk1Z6K4LMt3UM3AGrrKLk9jBOjwrXsY1psfAPY4Q"}]}
        ```
