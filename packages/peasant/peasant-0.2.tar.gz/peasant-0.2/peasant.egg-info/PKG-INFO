Description: # Candango Peasant
        
        Peasant is a protocol abstraction of how to control agents that need to
        communicate with a central entity or entities.
        
        We define agents as peasants and central entities(bases) as bastions.
        
        This project won't define the implementation, security level neither levels of
        redundancies but instead a minimal contract of what should be implemented.
        
        A bastion/peasant relationship could be defined as stateful or not. If stateful
        it is necessary to implement a session control in the bastion where peasants
        need to perform knocks(as knock at the door) in order to get permission or a
        valid session. In a stateless case we just ignore any knock implementation.
        
        What must be implemented in the protocol are nonce generation, consumption and
        validation on both sides and a directory list of available resources offered by
        a bastion for peasants to consume.
