        # Installation
        
        To install, you can use the Python package manager ``pip`` as follows:
        
        ```
        sudo pip install mldas
        ```
        
        Once installed on your system, the package can be loaded into any Python script as follows:
        
        ```
        from mldas import *
        ```
        
        ```
        python mldas/train.py configs/multilabel.yaml -v --depth 2 --lr 0.1 --epochs  2 --sample-size 1 --batch-size 128 --output-dir output_test
        ```
