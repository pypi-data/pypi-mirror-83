## Accessing Event Registry data through Python

This library contains classes that allow one to obtain from Event Registry (http://eventregistry.org) all available data, such as news articles, events, trends, etc.

The detailed documentation on how to use the library is available at the [project's wiki page](https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-python/wiki). Examples of use are in the [Examples folder in the repository](https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-python/tree/master/eventregistry/examples).

Changes introduced in the different versions of the module are described in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-python/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) as well as on the [Releases](https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-python/releases) page.

## Installation

Event Registry package can be installed using Python's pip installer. In the command line, simply type:

    pip install eventregistry

and the package should be installed. Alternatively, you can also clone the package from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-python. After cloning it, open the command line and run:

    python setup.py install

### Validating installation

To ensure the package has been properly installed run python and type:

```python
import eventregistry
```

If you don't get any error messages then your installation has been successful.

### Updating the package

As features are added to the package you will need at some point to update it. In case you have downloaded the package from GitHub simply do a `git pull`. If you have installed it using the `pip` command, then simply run

	pip install eventregistry --upgrade

### Authentication and API key

When making queries to Event Registry you will have to use an API key that you can obtain for free. The details how to obtain and use the key are described in the [Authorization](../../wiki/EventRegistry-class#authorization) section.

## Three simple examples to make you interested

**Print a list of recently added articles mentioning George Clooney**

```python
from eventregistry import *
er = EventRegistry(apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY)
q = QueryArticlesIter(conceptUri = er.getConceptUri("George Clooney"))
for art in q.execQuery(er, sortBy = "date"):
    print art
```

**Search for latest events related to Star Wars**

```python
from eventregistry import *
er = EventRegistry(apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY)
q = QueryEvents(conceptUri = er.getConceptUri("Star Wars"))
q.setRequestedResult(RequestEventsInfo(sortBy = "date", count=10))   # return event details for last 10 events
print er.execQuery(q)
```

**What are the currently trending topics**

```python
from eventregistry import *
er = EventRegistry(apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY)
# top 10 trending concepts in the news
q = GetTrendingConcepts(source = "news", count = 10)
print er.execQuery(q)
```
