Django Smartmin
===============

|Build Status| |codecov| |PyPI Release|

Smartmin was born out of the frustration of the Django admin site not
being well suited to being exposed to clients. It aims to allow you to
quickly build scaffolding which you can customize by using Django views.

It is very opinionated in how it works, if you don’t agree, Smartmin may
not be for you:

-  Permissions are used to gate access to each page, embrace permissions
   throughout and you’ll love this
-  CRUDL operations at the object level, that is, Create, Read, Update,
   Delete and List, permissions and views are based around this
-  URL automapping via the the CRUDL objects, this should keep things
   very very DRY

About Versions
==============

Smartmin tries to stay in lock step with the latest Django versions.
With each new Django version a new Smartmin version will be released and
we will save the major changes (possibly breaking backwards
compatibility) on these versions. This includes updating to the latest
version of Twitter Bootstrap.

The latest version is the 2.2.\* series which supports the Django 2.1.\*
and 2.2.\* releases series.
