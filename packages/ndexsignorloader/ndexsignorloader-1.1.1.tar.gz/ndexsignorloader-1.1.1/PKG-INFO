        Python application that loads Signor data into NDEx_
        
        This tool downloads data files from Signor_ and performs the following operations:
        
        **1\)** The text files are loaded into a network using this loadplan_
        
        **2\)** The edge attribute **direct** is set to **True** if value is **'t'** otherwise its set to **False**
        
        **3\)** Using values in the **databasea** and **databaseb** data files, the **represents** field found on each node is prefixed with **uniprot:** if the database value is **UNIPROT** and **signor:** if the database value is **SIGNOR**
        
        **4\)** The **location** node attribute is set to **cytoplasm** if its not set (which is case for all nodes in **Signor Complete - Human, Signor Complete - Rat, and Signor Complete - Mouse** networks)
        
        **5\)** The **location** node attribute with value **phenotypeList** is set to empty string
        
        **6\)** Any negative or non-numeric citations are removed from the **citation** edge attribute (There were multiple cases of -1 and **Other**). In addition, a specific PMC:## is updated to its pubmed id.
        
        **7\)** IF ``--edgecollapse`` flag is set on commandline, then edges between same nodes are collapsed if they have same **interaction** with attributes stored in lists with exception of **direct** which is a bool. The pubmed id is prepended (as html link) to each **sentence** attribute entry.
                In addition, a network attribute named **notes** is added with following text: **Edges have been collapsed with attributes converted to lists with exception of direct attribute**
        
        **8\)** The layout of the network is created using the spring layout, but with additional logic that positions nodes in a vertical based on value of the **location** node attribute. The ordering is as follows:
        
        * **extracellular** are placed at the top
        * **receptor** are below **extracellular**
        * **cytoplasm** are placed in the middle
        * **factor** are below **cytoplasm**
        * If attribute is empty, nodes are placed at the bottom
        
        **9\)** The following network attributes are set
        
        * **name** is set to data from Signor service **getPathwayData.php?pathway=** (except for the full/complete networks which have a more generic description)
        * **author** is set to data from Signor service **getPathwayData.php?pathway=** (unless its empty in which case its not added to network)
        * **organism** is set to **Human, 9606, Homo sapiens** (except for **Signor Complete - Rat, and Signor Complete - Mouse** networks)
        * **prov:wasGeneratedBy** is set to ndexsignorloader <VERSION> (example: ndexsignorloader 1.1.0)
        * **prov:wasDerivedFrom** set to URL to download data file (or in case of full networks its set to Signor site)
        * **version** is set to Abbreviated day-month-year (example: 05-Jun-2019)
        * **description** is taken from Signor service **getPathwayData.php?pathway=**
        * **rightsHolder** is set to **Prof. Gianni Cesareni**
        * **rights** is set to **Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)**
        * **reference** is set to citation for **SIGNOR: a database of causal relationships between biological entities**
        * **labels** is set to data from Signor service **getPathwayData.php?pathway=** (not set for full networks)
        * **type** is set to a list with **pathway** and if known type of pathway
        * **__normalizationversion** is set to **0.1**

        =======
        History
        =======
        
        1.1.1 (2020-10-16)
        -------------------
        
        * Removed NODE_LABEL_POSITION discrete mapping from style since it is
          not compatible with CX 2.0
        
        1.1.0 (2020-02-19)
        -------------------
        
        * Fixed bug where an empty pathway description file would cause loader to fail. Issue #1
        
        * Removed network visual properties: `NETWORK_CENTER_\*, NETWORK_ HEIGHT, NODE_SELECTION, SCALE_FACTOR, SIZE, WIDTH`
          cause they caused problems when displaying the network in Cytoscape
        
        * Fixed bug where URL for DOI in `reference` network attribute was incorrect
        
        * Set minimum version of ndex2 python client to 3.3.1 and maximum to less then 4.0.0
        
        * Set maximum version of ndexutil package to less then 2.0.0
        
        1.0.0 (2019-07-30)
        -------------------
        
        * **--edgecollapse** flag added which collapses all edges putting all attributes
          minus **direct** into lists. For **sentence** attribute each entry the
          list is now prepended with href link to citation labeled pubmed:#### In addition,
          if **--edgecollapse** flag is set then a **notes** network attribute is added to
          let user know.
        
        * **--style** can also accept NDEx UUID for network style. Network needs to be on  same
          server set in **--profile**
        
        0.3.0 (2019-07-29)
        -------------------
        
        * Added commandline flag **--visibility** that lets user dictate whether NEW networks are public or private (default is public)
        
        * Signor Full Human, Signor Full Rat, and Signor Full Mouse networks have been renamed
          to Signor Complete - Human, Signor Complete - Rat, Signor Complete - Mouse
        
        * On edges, replaced location attribute value of phenotypesList with empty string NSU-75
        
        * Added __iconurl network attribute and renamed type network attribute to networkType
        
        0.2.0 (2019-06-28)
        ------------------
        
        * Changed prov:wasDerivedFrom network attribute to just signor website URL for full networks
        
        * Removed author network attribute if no value is found
        
        * Removed labels attribute for full networks 
        
        0.1.0 (2019-06-27)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
