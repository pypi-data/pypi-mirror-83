Description
===========

This package provides a grid to display a scrollable list of records from a database accessed using the `solentware-base`_ package.


Installation Instructions
=========================

Install the package by typing

   python setup.py install

at the command prompt with setup.py in the current directory.

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> setup.py install

   For example

      C:\\Python33\\python setup.py install

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.3 setup.py install

         on Unix-like systems.

Use `Python`_ 3.3 or later.


Notes
=====

This package was written because I could not find something which behaved like a Delphi DBGrid, as remembered from the late 1990s.
