"""This module provides classes to hold the records from a database which are
currently displayed in a widget, and provide a way to synchronize the refresh
of widgets when the records are updated.

Each DataClient holds details of the data displayed on a control and
provides wrappers for the underlying database functions to support scrolling
and data update in the widget.  It provides an interface allowing each widget
to define, to the data source, the function to call when data in the source
file is changed.

Each DataSource holds details of which clients are to be redisplayed when
data in the source is changed and which primary or secondary index is used
to access data.  Widgets can be added and removed from these lists at will.

Wrappers assume that bsddb functions are called; these are emulated for other
databases.

Reads on secondary indexes return (secondary key, primary key) as (key, value).
An additional read is done using the primary key so that value is always the
primary data in key:value below.
Key is the key for primary reads or (key, value) for secondary reads.
For RECNO (and QUEUE) databases the primary key is a left justified '00'
filled 4 byte string base 256 with low order byte at left when returned
in a secondary read but is an integer when the key in a primary read.

Partial key can be specified to define a key range to be returned.
