        Description
        ===========
        
        This package provides a grid to display a scrollable list of records from a database accessed using the `solentware-base`_ package.
        
        
        Installation Instructions
        =========================
        
        Install the package by typing
        
           python setup.py install
        
        at the command prompt with setup.py in the current directory.
        
        You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:
        
           <path to python>/python<version> setup.py install
        
           For example
        
              C:\\Python33\\python setup.py install
        
                 on Microsoft Windows or
        
              python3.3 setup.py install
        
                 on Unix-like systems.
        
        Use `Python`_ 3.3 or later.
        
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        This package was written because I could not find something which behaved like a Delphi DBGrid, as remembered from the late 1990s.
