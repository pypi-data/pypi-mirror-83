# that name; for instance, we don't want to treat i486, i586 and i686
# as separate arches, but every time we see any of those we want to
# treat it as i386. 'weight' is an integer to be used for sort
# weighting if desired.

# to group related arches together. current is whether it's currently

# For LoadTuple, each entry in FLAVORS or LOADOUTS is something we
# consider a unique flavor or loadout. subs is an iterable of sub-
# flavors.
